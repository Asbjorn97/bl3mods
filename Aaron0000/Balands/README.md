### Balands includes the Unofficial Community Patch for Borderlands 3 within itself, so you don't need to run the Unofficial Community Patch separately from Balands. You can also use individual portions of the mod by checking out the "Individual Parts of Balands" folder and read the "Contents" file for details.

# DISCLAIMER: The numbers listed going from here down may not be 100% accurate in some cases. It may something like "Accuracy increased by 200%" but that doesn't mean it'll have an Accuracy of 200%+. Take the numbers with a grain of salt.

MAIN MENU CHANGES
-----------------
Added an item to the news section on the main menu to indicate Balands is active (Complete version and "Balance" files only.)


BASIC PLAYER CHANGES
--------------------
Doubled the base melee damage and base slam damage, while base slide damage has been increased by 260% (on par with the newly buffed base melee damage.) Players now hit harder without affecting certain gear like the Face-puncher or Stinger.


MAYHEM MODE CHANGES
-------------------
Removed or reduced most non-enemy health-based Mayhem mode scaling, other than enemy health, loot quality/quantity, shield damage, slide damage, slam damage, vehicle damage, and pet damage (which now displays on the pet cards).

Mayhem Scaling for Slide Damage is 6% per Mayhem Level.

Mayhem Scaling for Slam Damage is 10% per Mayhem Level.

Mayhem Scaling for Shield Damage is 24% per Mayhem Level.

Mayhem Scaling for Pet Damage Scaling is 55% per Mayhem level.

Mayhem Scaling for Vehicle Damage Scaling is 65% per Mayhem level.

Implemented mayhem scaling for Moze's gun damage to account for the heavy loss of damage from skills such as Fire in the Skag Den, Big Surplus, and Short Fuse no longer being Mayhem scaled. It is activated by investing a point into Armored Infantry.

Implemented the Mayhem scaling for Action skill damage in a different way to allow for individual character adjustments. They're now activated by investing one point in Violent Momentum, Persistence Hunter, or Fast Hand(s).

Experience gained in Mayhem Mode increased by 1.5 times (Mayhem 10 now gives 300% EXP instead of 200%, for example.)

Guns and grenades no longer receive increased damage from Mayhem levels. The Mayhem level text no longer displays on gear either (but your gear will still be regular Mayhem gear when the mod is no longer active.).

Nerfed enemy health scaling in Mayhem Mode. Enemy health now increases by 100% per Mayhem level, up to 1000% at Mayhem 10.

The "[Turn It Up To] Mayhem 11" modifier is now called "[None] Nay-hem". It can show up in Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.

Reduced the probability of finding green-rarity gear starting from Mayhem 6 and decreasing as the Mayhem Level is increased up to Mayhem 8.

Heavily reduced the health scaling of enemies in Arms Race to account for less power from Mayhem-leveled gear.

LOOT POOL CHANGES
-----------------
The cost for re-rolling anointments on gear has been reduced to 50 eridium.

Removed Uncommon gear from Earl's Veteran Rewards Machine, made quest reward items more common, made the item of the day a guaranteed Alien-Barrel weapon, increased amount of items in the vendor to 20.

Added a chance for the Manufacturer Rewards to deliver a Legendary weapon.

Replaced the Butcher and Lucian's Call in Loot-o-Gram redemption with a random drop from the slaughter boss loot pools.

Added the Mayhem 4 and Mayhem 6 exclusive gear to the regular legendary world drop pools (provided an appropriate Mayhem level is active.)

Added the Bekah, R.Y.N.A.H, Hunt(er), and Hunt(ress) to the regular legendary world drop pools.

Increased the chance of legendary pistols dropping in the Trial of Survival by x37.5.

Increased the chance of legendary heavy weapons dropping in the Trial of Fervor by x10.

Increased the chance of legendary sniper rifles dropping in the Trial of Cunning by x37.5.

Increased the chance of legendary shotguns dropping in the Trial of Supremacy by x20.

Increased the chance of legendary assault rifles dropping in the Trial of Discipline by x150. (The enemies here were particularly stingy with drops.)

Increased the chance of legendary SMGs dropping in the Trial of Instinct by x37.5.

Increased the chance of legendary grenades dropping in the Cistern of Slaughter by x10.

Increased the chance of legendary shields dropping in the Slaughterstar 3000 by x10.

Increased the chance of legendary artifacts and class mods dropping in the the Slaughter Shaft by x3 each.

Increased the amount of Legendary item drops in the Maliwan Takedown by 500%.

Increased the amount of Legendary item drops in the Guardian Takedown by 800%.

Improved the loot drops of Godliaths.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Zealots to drop Alien-Barrel Submachine Guns.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Tinks to drop Alien-Barrel Pistols.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Psychos to drop Alien-Barrel Shotguns.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Enforcers to drop Alien-Barrel Assault Rifles.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Goons to drop Alien-Barrel Sniper Rifles.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Goliaths to drop Alien-Barrel Heavy Weapons.

 ┗----Rationale: Given how Anointed enemies are practically mini-bosses in their own right, an extra reward in the form of a blue or purple alien-barrel gun seems fair. These drops can also occur from any of the named Anointed enemies excluding the Anointed Alpha.

Added a 20% chance for Road Dog to drop a purple Atlas grenade separately from his regular loot pool.

Added a 30% chance for Blinding Banshee to drop a purple Hyperion grenade separately from their regular loot pool.

Added a 30% chance for Lt. Preston to drop a purple Pangolin grenade separately from his regular loot pool.

Added a 30% chance for Crushjaw to drop a purple Tediore grenade separately from her regular loot pool.

Added a 30% chance for Lagromar to drop a purple Torgue grenade separately from his regular loot pool.

Added a 30% chance for Tink-Train to drop a purple Vladof grenade separately from her regular loot pool.

 ┗----Rationale: With guns and shields, you're at least able to farm them to some degree through either Earl's Veteran Rewards Machine or the Eridian Fabricator, but that isn't the case for grenades. With certain purple grenades being highly desirable and having no suitable Legendary alternative, late-game drop sources have been added for each manufacturer's purple grenades to provide an option to obtain them. Atlas grenades are only a 50% chance since there's less part variety due to lacking elements.

Increased the odds of a Sickle spawning as a Boom Sickle to 40%.

Increased Raging Titan's number of drops from its loot pool to 2.

Increased Tremendous Rex's number of drops from its loot pool to 2.

Increased Red Rain's number of drops from its loot pool to 2.

Increased Blue Fire's number of drops from its loot pool to 2.

Adjusted the Agonizer 9000's dedicated item drops. It now has a 30% chance to drop from either of its loot pools, the Crader's EM-P5 has been moved to the Dictator/Loaded Dice loot pool, and the Agonizer 1500 has been removed from both of the regular Agonizer 9000 dedicated item drop pools and given its own item pool with a 50% chance to drop.

Increased drop rates from Black, Yellow, and Red Power Troopers to 13.33%.

Increased drop rates from Pink and Blue Power Troopers to 20%.

Increased the number of Bloody Harvest Legendary drops from Captain Haunt to 3.

Increased the odds of Loot Ghosts dropping Bloody Harvest loot.

Increased the chance of GenIVIV dropping from her loot pool to 30%.

Increased the chance of Evil Lilith dropping from her loot pool to 60% to compensate for the obnoxiously long immunity phase.

Increased the chance of finding Arms-Race exclusive Legendary gear in the Arms Race chests that are locked behind fights.

Increased the number of Legendary class mod drops from Trial bosses to three when they would normally drop one.

Added Red Rain's loot pool to Rohner.

Added Blue Fire's loot pool to King Gnasher in replacement of his Westergun drop.

Added the Bekah and Superstreamer to Tyreen's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Tyreen dropping from her loot pool to 50%.

Added the Earworm to Graveward's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Graveward dropping from its loot pool to 40%.

Added the Hunt(er) to Manvark's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Manvark dropping from his loot pool to 40%.

Added the Cloud Kill to Rampager's Loot Pool, switched the Duc with the Quadomizer in Rampager's loot pool and added the Duc to Dreg and Rage, increased the chance of the Rampager dropping from its loot pool to 40%.

Switched the Ten Gallon with the Messy Breakup in GenIVIV's loot pool and added the Ten Gallon to Rax.

Added the Hand of Glory to Muldock's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Muldock dropping from his loot pool to 30%.

Added the Burning Summit to The Unstoppable with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Null-Pointer and Vault Hero to Gigamind, increased the chance of Gigamind dropping from its loot pool to 30%.

Added the Vibra-Pulse to Sylestro's Loot Pool, increased the chance of them dropping from their loot pool to 20%.

Added the Boo to Private Beans with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Ember's Purge to Loco Chantelle, increased chance of Loco Chantelle dropping from her loot pool to 20%.

Added the Scoville to Freddie, increased chance of Freddie dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the Rico to Jack-bot and increased the chance of Jack-bot dropping from its pool to 70%.

Added Digby's Smooth Tube to Junpei Goat Eater, increased chance of Junpei dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the Robo-Melter Masher to Tricksy Nick with a 10% chance of dropping.

Added the Melt-Facer to Fabricator with a 10% chance to drop. Drops separately from ION CANNON.

Added the Just Kaus to EVIL Saint Lawrence, increased chance of Lawrence dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the All-In to Golden Bullion with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Acid Burn to DEGEN-3, increased chance of DEGEN-3 dropping from its loot pool to 20%.

Added La Varlope to Rudy Varlope with a 10% chance to drop, fixed his name not showing up properly in Playthrough 2.

Added Ember's Blaze to Stanley with a 10% chance of dropping.

Added the Double Downer to Gorgeous Armada, increased chance of Armada dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the Short Stick to Yeti, increased chance of Yeti dropping from its loot pool to 50%.

Gave the singing fish found throughout the Guns, Love, and Tentacles DLC a small chance of producing a Fish Slap.

Added the Pearl of Knowledge to Kratch.

Added the Firecracker and non-Legendary Love Drill to Eleanor, increased chance of Eleanor dropping from her loot pool to 40%.

Added the Seventh Sense to Wendigo, increased chance of Wendigo dropping from his loot pool to 30%.

Added the Initiative to Amach, increased chance of Amach dropping from his loot pool to 30%.

Added The Cure to Kritchy, increased chance of Kritchy dropping from its loot pool to 30%.

Added the Cocky Bastard to Gmork, increased chance of Gmork dropping from his loot pool to 50%.

Added the Skullmasher to Kukuwajack, increased chance of Kukuwajack dropping from its loot pool to 30%.

Added the Sacrificial Lamb to Eista as a guaranteed drop, make Eista have a 30% chance to drop a DLC2 item of each type, and fattened up his drops with more money, eridium, and more chances for Legendary gear.

Added an additional 20% chance to drop from each of the Underboss drop pools and a 10% chance to drop the Pricker to Joey Ultraviolet.

Added the Quickdraw to Ipswitch Dunne.

Added the Chalice to Lani Dixon.

Added the Bubble Blaster to Haddon Marr.

Added the Peashooter to Adelai Bronson.

Added Doc Hina's Miracle Bomb to Doc Stanley with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Beast to Lectrikor.

Added the Icebreaker to Lasodactyl.

Added the Vendetta to Kormash.

Added the Core Buster to Bellik Primus.

Added the Splinter to the Quartermaster.

Added the Dakota to the Ruiner.

Added the Ashen Beast, Minor Kong, P.A.T. Mk. II, and Sawpenny to the Psycho Krieg DLC unique item world drop pool, and made the pool drop twice whenever it drops.

Added the P.A.T. Mk. III to General Blisterpus.

Added chances to get legendary Fustercluck DLC items from Spongeboss.

Added more chances to drop Arms Race Legendary Gear from the Heavyweight Harker

Added the Company Man to the Gravekeeper, increased chance of Gravekeeper dropping from its loot pool to 30%.

 ┗----Rationale: The reason the Company Man has been added to the Gravekeeper is purely a quality-of-life change for allegiance playthroughs so that said playthroughs don't have to wait until Hemovorous to get a Company Man. Hemovorous will still be a far more reliable farm for Company Men, however.

Added a chance of dropping a Mysterious Amulet from the Seer.

Lowered the world drop quantity of the Valkyries and made them always drop three pieces of dedicated loot.

Increased the amount of chances for Anathema to drop its loot, one guaranteed piece of Mayhem 6 gear, and a significant amount of money, eridium, and blue or higher gear.

Increased the amount of chances for Scourge to drop his loot, multiple chances for pieces of Mayhem 6 gear, and a metric crapton of money, eridium, and blue or higher gear.

Made Hemovorous always drop three pieces of non-Company Man dedicated loot, three guaranteed Company Men, and a significant amount of money, eridium, and blue or higher gear.

Added three guaranteed Mayhem 6 drops to Vermivorous, a 50% chance to drop a random Director's Cut item, and more loot in general.


ENEMY CHANGES
-------------
Eista now retains "the Invincible" in his name for rematches after "We Slass! Part 3". Eista the Invincible's total health has been buffed, now roughly halfway between Wotan and Scourge.

Reduced the total health of Evil Brick, Evil Mordecai, Evil Lilith, Spongeboss, Locomobius, and Dr. Benedict by roughly 35% each.

Reduced the total health of the Psychoreaver by roughly 40%.

Reduced the total health of the Seer by roughly 60%.

Reduced the total health of Captain Haunt by 50%, and his phylacteries by 80%.

Reduced the total health of Joey Ultraviolet by 50%.

Reduced the total health of Hemovorous' final form and Vermivorous by roughly 40%.

Anathema the Relentless now only triggers an immune phase at 50% and 0% of a health bar instead of every quarter of a health bar. 5 immunity phases total.

 ┗----Rationale: Scourge the Invincible also has a lot of immunity phases, but there is variety to said immunity phases. Anathema's immunity phases are largely monotonous, so reducing the amount of these phases improves the flow of the fight.

Reduced the damage towards non-player characters of the Diadems spawned during Scourge the Invincible's fight.

 ┗----Rationale: The Scourge fight ends up turning into a cycle of "Pop Scourge with the Diadems repeatedly, get teleported, repeat." By lowering the Diadem damage, you now actually have to fight Scourge.

Tweaked the Badass enemy spawn rates in the Slaughter Shaft. Badass Zealots and Tinks are now less common while Badass Enforcers, Goliaths, Goons, and Psychos are more common.

 ┗----Rationale: The Badass and Armored Badass Zealots/Tinks are each their own type that can spawn (so four different badasses). Coupled with the fact that Zealots and Tinks are the most common enemy types you face in the COV forces, the Slaughter Shaft largely turned into a gauntlet of heavy weapon spam and tink turrets with the occasional blip from a different Badass type or Anointed enemy. Hence the reduction in Badass Zealot/Tink spawn rates and increase in other Badass spawn rates.

Enemies no longer spawn with cryo-element guns for the most part.

 ┗----Rationale: For enemies that are clearly cryo such as certain beasts or Heavies, being able to slow the player down isn't an issue as the player is able to easily determine that they should stay back if they want to avoid being slowed. That isn't viable for common gun-wielding enemies. Getting lightly tickled by a single bullet from some cannon fodder and suddenly becoming unable to dodge a hail of punishment is very irritating, and it is too difficult to try to determine if every single gun-wielding is using a cryo weapon or not by looking at the elemental glow on their weapon.

Anointed Enforcers should no longer spawn outside of the encounters with the Anointed Alpha, Luke, and Muldock.

 ┗----Rationale: If 2/3 of the moves this enemy didn't make them immune to damage (as well as not being able to switch between the immunity actions repeatedly), this enemy would be stomachable. But one can potentially waste minutes waiting for this enemy to actually be vulnerable. Removing this enemy improves the flow of combat.


VEHICLE CHANGES
---------------
Lowered the variants of Jetbeasts' health closer to the health of the vehicles in the base game.

Vehicle weapons have been adjusted to be more on par with the default weapons instead of significantly worse for the most part (was unable to adjust the Jetbeast weapons).

Vehicle boosters have been diversified in terms of stats. Laser Wings/Jet Engine/Sonic Booster now have longer durations but slower recharge rates, while Firestarter/Toxic Booster/Thrust Turbine have lower boost duration but higher recharge rates and lower recharge delay.

Vehicle armor has been adjusted to actually have a downside instead of not actually reducing speed. It now increases Boost Consumption by 20%/30%/40% for Technicals/Outrunners/Cyclones and Jetbeasts respectively.


OTHER CHANGES/FIXES
-------------------
Increased the amount of sniper rifle ammo given by SDUs by 3 additional ammo per SDU.

Typhon, Claptrap, Ava, Lilith, Maya, Lorelei, Clay, Hammerlock (DLC2), and Gaige have had their overall movement speed increased to be 50% higher than a standard Vault Hunter's and their sprint speed has been increased to 75%.

Applied a band-aid fix to Vendor Crashing by adjusting how the Item of the Day appears on the outside of the vendor.

Fixed the Digi-Clone's Dahl pistol appearing in Maurice's 30th week Black Market vendor. Said week now spawns with a Nova Berner instead alongside the usual Hellwalker and Firestorm.

Made the Hunt(ed), Hunt(er), Hunt(ress), and Revengenador Legendary items.

 ┗----Rationale: There are two reasons for this change. The primary reason is that a player will often overlook blue items, so making them Legendary should prevent them from being carelessly overlooked to some extent. The other minor reason is that they exist in the world drop pool for Legendary gear and it makes sense for them to be Legendary in return (the ECHO-2 remains white for comedic reasons.)
 
Changed the way ammo drops occur so that they should now drop more ammo for what you actually need.

Fixed Beef Plisken yeeting his loot into the abyss.

Fixed the Slaughterstar bosses dropping their loot into the abyss.

Fixed Guns, Love, and Tentacles/Fantastic Fustercluck enemies not dropping shields.

Fixed Siren COMs sometimes spawning with a blank part.

Made regular Jakobs shotguns more likely to spawn with higher projectile count.

Made purple grenades always spawn with three parts instead of sometimes spawning with two.


GEAR CHANGES
------------
Damage on almost all Legendary and Unique gear has been adjusted to a less spongey environment (things that performed well in the usual Mayhem 10 will almost assuredly have the damage numbers lowered, but not necessarily be less effective). Nearly every Legendary piece of gear should be at minimum viable.

Some changes will mention base damage multiplier (mostly legendary and unique guns). This is a damage multiplier of the weapon without influence from other parts, so if a weapon's base damage multiplier is 4 for example, it is four times stronger than a normal gun. Some of these items I was unable to find the original value of (in which case they will mention "Set base damage multiplier to...")


# GUNS

ATLAS GENERAL GUN CHANGES
---------------------------
Increased Assault Rifle Damage by 20%.

Removed Heavy Weapon Movement Speed Penalty.

 ┗----Rationale: It makes little sense for only some heavy weapons to have a movement speed penalty while others do not. Moving slower also just sucks. The same change has been made for Vladof weapons.

COV GENERAL GUN CHANGES
-----------------------
No changes.

DAHL GUNS
---------
Increased Damage of Semi-Auto Firing Mode by 20% and improved Accuracy Spread by 50% for Pistols and SMGs.

Increased SMG Fire Rate and Magazine Size by 40% each. Adjusted the fire rate of burst-fire parts to counteract the base Dahl SMG fire rate increase.

 ┗----Rationale: SMGs were a bit lacking in DPS compared to other weapon types when I crunched the numbers, so I buffed the mag size and fire rate to make better use of that stupidly high ammo pool. Same goes for Hyperion and Maliwan SMGs.
 
HYPERION GENERAL GUN CHANGES
----------------------------
Increased SMG Fire Rate and Magazine Size by 40% each, and Damage by 12%.

Increased Sniper Rifle Damage by 38%. 

JAKOBS GENERAL GUN CHANGES
--------------------------
Assault Rifle Masher Trigger - Improved Spread by 30%, reduced Recoil Height by 15%, improved Weapon Sway by 25%, removed Fire Rate penalty, and increased Magazine Size by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The AR masher trigger was inferior to the pistol masher grip in most stats, so it has been made roughly equal to it. As for the ammo cost not being lowered, an increase in magazine size should be sufficient instead.
 
MALIWAN GENERAL GUN CHANGES
---------------------------
Increased SMG Fire Rate and Magazine Size by 40% each, and Damage by 18%.

TEDIORE GENERAL GUN CHANGES
---------------------------
No changes.

TORGUE GENERAL GUN CHANGES
--------------------------
Increased Pistol Damage by 12.5%, Fire Rate by 20%, and improved Reload Speed by 15%.

Increased Assault Rifle Damage by 40%, Fire Rate and Projectile Speed by 20%, and decreased Recoil Width by 15% as well as making them fully automatic.

Increased Shotgun Fire Rate by 25%.

Increased Heavy Weapon Magazine Size by one and made them fully automatic.

 ┗----Rationale: Torgue heavy weapons were pretty solid before, but low-magazine versions required loading an awful lot. One more shot per magazine should remedy that to a degree.
 
VLADOF GUNS
-----------
Increased Assault Rifle Damage by 30%, decreased Vertical Recoil by 25%.

Increased Sniper Rifle Damage by 10%, Magazine Size by 30%, and improved Reload Speed by 20%.

Increased Heavy Weapon Damage by 17%, removed Movement Speed Penalty.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Pistol Zip-Rocket and Taser Underbarrels.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Assault Rifle Grenade Launcher and Shotgun Underbarrels.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Sniper Rifle Rocket Launcher and Shotgun Underbarrels.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Heavy Weapon Big Boy Underbarrel.

 ┗----Rationale: Underbarrels are one of the main features of Vladof weaponry, but they weren't very useable due to being stingy with the ammo consumption/regeneration balance. They should now be useable on a more regular basis.
 
ATLAS LEGENDARY GUNS
--------------------
Carrier - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.5 to 0.7.

O.P.Q-System - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.8 to 1, reduced the fire rate by 56%.

Portals and Shite - Damage increased by 55%, 20% critical damage added.

Rebel Yell - Fire rate lowered by 20%.

Replay - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.2 to 1.75, fire rate reduced by 30%, damage radius increased by 140%.

 ┗----Rationale: While the fire rate is lower, the damage was also adjusted accordingly. It'll be more effective with the ammo you chew through with the post-tracker fire rate boost now.

Linc - No change other than a possible damage adjustment.

Multi-Tap - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.8, reload speed increased by 190%.

 ┗----Rationale: The cryo rocket launched upon reloading is supposed to be the special feature of this gun, but reloading all the time interferes with the flow of combat. Making the reload lightning-quick resolves that.

Res - No change other than a possible damage adjustment.

Freeman - Base damage multiplier set to 1.7.

Plumage - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.225, accuracy reduced by 50%, ammo cost set to 2.

 ┗----Rationale: The Plumage's identity was basically "Ruby's Wrath but better." It has been altered to "Ruby's Wrath but bigger" so it isn't just a direct upgrade.

Ruby's Wrath - Base damage multiplier set to 1.

ATLAS UNIQUE GUNS
-----------------
Peacemonger - Base damage multiplier set to 0.7, ammo cost set to 3.

ATLAS REGULAR GUNS
------------------
Pattern [NULL] - Increased Damage by 20%, Magazine Size by 1, and Explosion Radius by 30%.

Pattern Black - No change.

Pattern Red - No change.

Q-System - Adjusted Damage to (roughly) match the pre-Atlas-AR damage buff.

V-System - Added 20% increased Critical Hit Damage.

N-System - No change.

AX-7 - No change.

AX-19 - No change.

AX-88 - Reduced ammo cost to one and increased Projectile Speed by 57%.


COV LEGENDARY GUNS
------------------
Embrace the Pain - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.2, accuracy improved, fire rate increased by 70%, heat rate reduced by 20%, self-damage reduced by 50%.

NoPewPew - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.1 to 0.65, ammo cost set to 3.

 ┗----Rationale: Instead of gutting the power of this weapon, it's been given the ION CANNON treatment and increased the ammo cost. It'll also make x4 and x5 versions not so blatantly inferior to x3 versions.

Pain is Power - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.2, heat rate reduced by 40%, self-damage reduced by 50%.

Rebound - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.25.

Sawbar - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 0.75, made the projectile split happen earlier.

Seeryul Killer - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.4 to 1.2, kill effect stack bonus set to 16.6% per stack.

Stauros' Burn - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.3, self-ignite chance set to 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: If you're going to use this gun, you're using it for the special effect. The chance is now guaranteed for that purpose.

Zheitsev's Eruption - Set maximum reload-debuff to 100%, repair speed improved by 32.5%, fire rate increased by 25%.

 ┗----Rationale: Spend less time using this weapon as a debuff tool and more as an actual weapon.

Gargoyle - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1, glob damage set to 150%, glob chance set to 33%.

 ┗----Rationale: The glob changes were made as a way to counteract spamming the blobs after the gun breaks.

Hydrafrost - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.55, amp damage set to 50%.

Killing Word - Accuracy improved by 20%.

Linoge - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.05 to 0.6, heat rate improved by 65%, accuracy improved 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: What good is a swarm of bullets if 90% of them miss and you spend half of your time reloading?

Pestilence - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.9 to 1.15, 70% radiation damage resistance added.

 ┗----Rationale: The reload-nova is powerful but it also leads to the player falling into FFYL often. The radiation resistance means the nova is useable without being forced into wearing a Red Suit.

Psycho Stabber - Base damage multiplier reduced from 1.25 to 0.9, melee damage bonus reduced to 250%, projectiles now actually deal melee damage, melee damage bonus no longer factors in gear or skill bonuses.

 ┗----Rationale: We have an actual example of a knife-firing gun that deals melee damage with said knives in the game (Blade Fury.) It makes sense to allow the original knife-lobber to deal melee damage from the launched knives as well.

Skeksil - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.15 to 1, bonus projectile damage reduced from 2 to 1 (weapon card damage).

Tizzy - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 0.95, reload speed improved by 25%.

Globetrottr - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.

Major Kong - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.

Mechanic - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1. 

Yellowcake - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 1.

COV UNIQUE GUNS
---------------
Brad Luck - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.025 to 1.35.

Sawpenny - No change.

The Beast - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.4.

Hangin' Chadd - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.7 to 0.8.

The Killing Word - Base damage multiplier set to 1.4, improved the accuracy spread by 20%.

Agonizer 1500 - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.25 to 1.35, repair speed increased by 50%, magazine size increased by 2 rounds, heat-per-shot reduced by 66%.

 ┗----Rationale: 80% of your combat time consisting of slowly reloading a weapon usually does not make for an enjoyable experience. More magazine size and faster repairs alleviate this.

Hot Drop - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.7.

Minor Kong - No change.

Porta-Pooper 5000 - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.45 to 3.5.

COV REGULAR GUNS
----------------
Chucka - No change.

Zooka - No change.

Shredda - No change.

Bombbanayshun - Projectile count increased by 3, accuracy reduced by 100%, splash radius reduced by 50%, and ammo cost increased by 1.

 ┗----Rationale: Before these changes, it really was basically just a worse Zooka. The changes that have been made give it more of an identity to distinguish itself from other COV heavy weapons.
 
Holey-Man - No change.

Preecher - No change.

Splainer - No change.

Blastphemy - Increased damage by 150% and projectile speed by 200%.

Ratatater - No change.

BizZurker - No change.

Purferator - No change.

Wizzperer - No change.


DAHL LEGENDARY GUNS
-------------------
Barrage - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.05, burst-count set to 7.

Breath of the Dying - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.3 to 1.3, set on-kill projectile damage to 10 times card damage, removed splash damage, doubled the flight speed of on-kill projectiles.

Corruption - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 0.9, now deals corrosive damage instead of kinetic, reduced Corruption bonus to 20% per stack, increased projectiles produced to 3, reduced initial projectile speed by 50%, made projectiles now accelerate over 3 seconds to ten times the initial speed, fixed projectiles not being boosted by assault rifle damage.

 ┗----Rationale: The Corruption on-kill projectiles were slower than a one-legged skag trying to crawl up a hill. Now the projectiles start out extra slow but quickly acclerate towards their target. As for making it deal corrosive damage, the on-kill projectiles would produce corrosive damage-over-time on struck enemies. Thus it makes sense for the gun itself to deal corrosive damage.

Good Juju - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.25 to 0.65, set critical hit stack bonus to 8%, fixed secondary firing mode not dealing as much damage as it should.

Kaos - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.2, increased "radsplosion" damage to 5 times card damage from 4.

Star Helix - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.85, ammo cost set to 2, 14 rounds added to magazine.

 ┗----Rationale: Rather than making each bullet do a pittance of damage, it has been given an increase in ammo cost.

Soulrender - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.7 to 1.1, set the amount of skulls spawned from 2 to 1 (this was apparently a thing), increased skull spawn chance to 33%, set skull damage to match card damage.

Warlord - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.25, set ammo saving chance to 66%.

AAA - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.9 to 1.15.

Hornet - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1. 

Nemesis - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.2 to 1.725. 

Night Flyer - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.35 to 1.5.

The Blanc - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.25 to 1.4, set damage per stack to 7%.

9-Volt - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.75. 

Blood-Starved Beast - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 0.85, set explosion chance to 15%, set explosion damage to 1.5 times card damage, fixed it to get SMG boosts instead of AR boosts.

Boomer - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.3. 

Crader's EMP-5 - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.8 to 1.05. 

Hellfire - Base damage multiplier increased from 1.1 to 1.25, set damage-over-time chance to be 666%, set damage-over-time to 2.5 times higher than average Dahl SMG DoT damage.

 ┗----Rationale: This weapon's schtick is based on damage-over-time, so we need to make the DoT worthwhile. 100% chance would be enough to guarantee a DoT on most enemies, the 666% chance is just for flavor.

Kaoson - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.25 to 0.8, accuracy and critical penalties removed.

Night Hawkin - Set base damage multiplier to 0.525.

Ripper - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.5 to 1.05, set post-melee gun damage bonus to 100%, increased melee damage to 200%, melee damage bonus no longer factors in gear or skill bonuses.

 ┗----Rationale: This gun encourages a hack n' blast playstyle, so it has been altered to better suit such a style.

Sleeping Giant - Post-reload damage buff set to 35%, post-reload fire rate buff set to 35%, the post-reload critical damage buff is now 50%.

Torrent - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.7 to 1.275, fire rate and mag size adjusted to counteract Dahl SMG buffs.

Vanquisher - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.25, et sliding bonuses to 50% each and added bonus damage to actual sliding, fire rate bonus now affects burst fire delay.

Autoaime - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 1.2.

Sand Hawk - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.64. 

Stalker - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 3.

Malak's Bane - Base damage multiplier raised from 3.3 to 3.5, shotgun-mode ammo cost set to 2, standard mode fire rate increased by 75%.

Hail - Base damage multiplier lowered from 5 to 0.6, critical hit damage set to 100%, set lifesteal to 0.5%.

 ┗----Rationale: This is one of the few weapons that was deliberately nerfed. You shouldn't be able to get a top tier weapon as easily as you can get this. Same goes for the Crit.

Kaleidoscope - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.1 to 1.25, amp damage set to 65%, amp chance set to 100%.

HYPERION LEGENDARY GUNS
-----------------------
Brainstormer - No change.

Conference Call - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.15 to 1, ncreased base projectile count by 2.

Convergence - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.8 to 0.85. 

Face-puncher - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.3 to 0.6. 

Fearmonger - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.4 to 0.425. 

Guardian 4N631 - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.7, set maximum distance bonus to 120%, increased projectile speed by 75%, made description more accurate.

 ┗----Rationale: While it can still be used as a stat-stick to boost the damage on other means of offense, it has been adjusted so that it is now actually viable as a weapon.

Heart Breaker - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.1, set lifesteal to 1.5%, added 25% critical hit damage bonus.

Iceburger - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.5 to 2.5.

Phebert - No change.

Reflux - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.3 to 1, increased projectile count by one and magazine size by 40%.

Cheap Tips - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.1, set chip-drop chance to 15%, damage boost set to 10%.

Crossroads - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.2 to 0.6, projectile count and accuracy nerfs reverted.

Gold Rush - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.25, 

Handsome Jackhammer - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.7 to 1.15. 

Hyperfocus XZ41 - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 1.4.

Oldridian - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1, reload speed improved by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: A boost to reload speed now means you can switch to a preferable element more readily.

Predatory Lending - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.8 to 1.1.

Proprietary License - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.8 to 1.35.

JAKOBS LEGENDARY GUNS
---------------------
Bekah - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 0.7.

Blade Fury - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.55 to 1.29, melee damage bonus no longer factors in gear or skill bonuses.

Clairovoyance - Base damage multiplier lwoered from 2.5 to 0.75.

Gatling Gun - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.95, recoil-per-shot improved by 24%, accuracy improved by 33%, vertical recoil improved by 52.5%, horizontal recoil improved by 15%.

Hand of Glory - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.9 to 1.2.

Lead Sprinkler - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.85, splash radius set to 120, lowered speed of bonus projectiles by roughly 19%, improved accuracy by 50%, improved vertical recoil by 25%, improved horizontal recoil by 30%, improved recoil-per-shot by 20%.

 ┗----Rationale: The child projectiles have been adjusted so that they can hit smaller targets.

Mutant - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 1.4, mproved overall recoil control by 35%, now deals radiation damage instead of kinetic.

Rowan's Call - Base damage multiplier lowered from 4 to 1.2. 

Stonethrower - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 1.2, removed the ricochet text at the bottom of the card.

Amazing Grace - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.6 to 1.25, 30% critical hit damage added.

Bite Size - No change.

Bloom - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.875, recoil improved by 35%, adjusted description to be more accurate.

King's/Queen's Call - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 0.8, ifesteal set to 0.25%.

Maggie - Base damage multiplier lowered from 0.62 to 0.3.

Little Yeeti - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 0.8, adjusted it so that a masher grip will now increase projectile count to 10 instead of 6.

 ┗----Rationale: This change was made so that the masher variant wasn't blatantly worse than the standard version.

Love Drill - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.7, set Shock chance to 50%, set shock damage to 50%, set innate critical hit damage bonus to 100%.

Lucky 7 - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.7 to 1.05, reload mod chance set to 33% (how often each of them will roll and show up), set "7" roll chance to 20%, "7" damage reduced by 65%, reload speed increased by 66%.

 ┗----Rationale: The Lucky 7 has been adjusted so that you can actually use it effectively as a normal gun instead of spending a copious amount of time trying to get a good roll. If you still insist on fishing for a good roll though, you can do it faster.

Seventh Sense - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.

The Companion - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.15, status effect damage doubled, removed accuracy penalty.

The Duc - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.2. 

The Flood - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.

Trickshot - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 0.7, added 40% critical hit damage.

Unforgiven - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.6 to 1.6, set innate critical hit damage bonus to 250% from 400%, reduced sway while zoomed-in by 85%. "Scopeless" sight now transforms the Unforgiven into a masher with an ammo cost of 2 and now spawns less frequently.

 ┗----Rationale: Changing the scopeless part to behave like a masher is partially to make the scopeless version worth considering over a scoped version, as well as to add a bit of spice to the weapon beyond being a stat stick for critical hit damage. 

Wagon Wheel - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.3 to 1.45. 

Hellwalker - Base damage multiplier lowered from 5 to 1.5. 

Nimble Jack - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.45 to 1.2, added 30% critical hit damage.

One-Pump Chump - Base damage multiplier lowered from 12 to 10, added 50% critical hit damage.

Robin's Call - Adjusted description to be more accurate.

Sledge's Shotgun - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.6, Sledge's Super Shotgun now also behaves like the triple barrel accessory; higher ammo cost, projectile count, and worse accuracy.

 ┗----Rationale: The "Super" implies a significant increase or change over the standard version. Increasing the burst-fire count by one doesn't amount to much of a difference (especially since the delay between being able to fire again is increased). So now this special triple-barrel accessory actually behaves more like one.

TK's Wave - Base damage multiplier lowered from 5 to 1.5, improved the accuracy considerably, increased projectile speed by 25%, reduced damage of Heatwave and Shockwave by 20%, made it more likely to spawn with higher projectile counts.

 ┗----Rationale: The 20% damage reduction to the elemental Waves is simply to be consistent with how elemental parts reduce damage on most other weapons.

The Garcia - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.25, lowered ammo cost to 1, increased projectile count by 2, improved accuracy spread by 15%, reduced vertical recoil by 40%, increased fire rate by 60%.

The Tidal Wave - Base damage multiplier lowered from 5 to 1.5, improved accuracy slightly, increased projectile speed by 150%, set ammo cost to 3, made it more likely to spawn with higher projectile counts.

 ┗----Rationale: The reason for ammo cost being increased is because this thing now hits like a truck if you manage to land all the projectiles.

Bird of Prey - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.15, set bonus projectile damage to match card damage from 600%.

Cocky Bastard - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.2, set bonus shock damage to 50% from 150%.

Headsplosion - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.175, removed critical hit damage penalty, increased splash radius by 50%.

Ionic Disruptor - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.4, set post-melee damage bonus to 66%, increased melee damage to 200%.

Monocle - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.15 to 0.5. 

Skullmasher - Base damage multiplier lowered from 0.75 to 0.4, made accuracy spread wider by 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: This love child between a shotgun and a sniper was leaning more towards the sniper side. The accuracy penalty leads to still being useful at mid-long range but it won't be driving nails like a typical sniper rifle now.

Unseen Threat - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 1.2, set ricochet damage to 33% of card damage, adjusted description to be more accurate.

Wedding Invitation - Set ricochet damage to 2 times card damage from 2.928.

JAKOBS UNIQUE GUNS
------------------
Icebreaker - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.625.

Pa's Rifle - No change other than a possible damage adjustment.

Quickdraw - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.25 to 0.9, amp damage increased to 50%, amp duration increased to 4 seconds.

Robo-Melter - Set base damage multiplier to 1.

Rogue-Sight - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.7 to 0.85.

Seventh Sense - Damage increased by 40%.

Dakota - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1, incendiary damage set to +50%, shock damage set to +100%, elemental shot chance set to 50%.

Fingerbiter - Set base damage multiplier to 1.3

Splinter - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.3 to 1.6, removed the "1 ricochet" text.

The Cure - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.4 to 1.55, lifesteal set to 1.5%.

The Shoddy - Set base damage multiplier to 1.

The Hunt(ed) - Robot damage bonus set to 50%, added 50% critical hit damage.

The Hunt(er) - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.25, creature damage bonus set to 50%, added 50% critical hit damage.

The Hunt(ress) - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.05, humanoid damage bonus set to 50%, added 50% critical hit damage.

 ┗----Rationale: The Hunt rifles have been adjusted to be similar to the Buffalo or Elephant Gun of older titles; high damage but no scope.

The Ice Queen - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.4.

JAKOBS REGULAR GUNS
-------------------
Marshal - Increased Damage by 15% and Handling by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: More fire rate is typically good on a weapon until you realize it is a semi-automatic weapon. So this one has been given the niche of handling well.

Peacekeeper - Improved Reload Speed by 20% and Magazine Size by 25%.

 ┗----Rationale: This one's been changed to suit more of a spray-and-pray style, hence the reload and mag size bonuses.

Ranger - No change.

Clipper - No change.

Repeater - Increased Damage and Fire Rate by 18%.

Carbine - No change.

Longrider - Increased Critical Damage by 30% and Reload Speed by 20%.

Scattergun - No change.

Stagecoach - No change.

Cheechako - Increased Damage by 10%.

Calipeen - No change.

Muckamuck - No change.


MALIWAN LEGENDARY GUNS
----------------------
Beacon - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 0.725, set reload-nova damage to 8.2 times card damage from 5, reduced magazine size by 50%, improved reload speed by 40%, increased fire rate by 40%, increased splash radius by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The special feature of the Beacon is largely ignored due to standard gun usage being far superior compared to the reload-nova. The changes made allow the Beacon to be effective both with simply firing the weapon or using the gimmick.

Free Radical - Base damage multiplier lowered from 4 to 0.8.

Frozen Devil - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.25 to 0.3, increased Ice Spike damage multiplier from 1 to 10, reduced Cryogenic-Mode frozen damage bonus to 2 times card damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Slowly freezing an enemy in order to be able to deal sufficient damage isn't the most enjoyable gameplay loop. The Ice Spike mode is now efficient enough for standard combat while the freeze-for-bonus-damage gimmick is worth considering on tough enemies.

Grease Trap - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.2 to 1, set Grease Mode grease damage to 10% of card damage from 20%, reduced Grease Mode fire rate by 38%.

Hellshock - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.25 to 0.85, reduced projectile count to 1.

Hyper-Hydrator - No change.

Ice Pick - No change.

Sellout - No change.

Superball - Doubled splash radius, made it fully automatic, added 50% critical hit damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Making it fully-automatic is a quality-of-life change for your fingers, the critical hit damage is to reward skillful bouncing, and the splash radius boost is to discourage getting point-blank in something's face to reap the critical damage benefits.

Thunderball Fists - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.25 to 1.7, splash radius doubled, ammo cost set to 1, made the thunderball faster.

Blind Sage - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.25 to 1.2.

Chandelier - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.2 to 1.25, ammo cost reduced by 2.

Frequency - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.95, magazine size increased by 6, adjusted description to be more accurate.

 ┗----Rationale: Depending on the parts, you would not be able to use the maximum bonus of this weapon. The extra mag size remedies that.

Insider - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.3 to 1, ammo cost reduced by 1, tweaked the damage formula.

Kill-o'-the-Wisp - Base damage multiplier raised from 4 to 10, fixed an issue with the ammo cost being connected with the damage multiplier value, fixed the damage formula, ammo cost is reduced to 3.

Mind-Killer - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.17 to 1.3.

Nothingness - Set "flak" damage to 2.5 times card damage from 3.

Projectile Recursion - Base damage multiplier lowered from 7 to 4.

Trevanator - Base damage multiplier lowered from 5 to 2.1.

Vosk's Deathgrip - Base damage multiplier lowered from 5 to 3.25, ammo cost reduced to 3, secondary mode ammo-regeneration delay set to 4 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: The intended play-loop for this weapon revolves around using the singularity to immobolize enemies so that you can zap the daylights out of them with the primary fire. The secondary regeneration delay change now allows you to reliably do that.

Cloud Kill - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.825 to 1.3.

Cutsman - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.5 to 1.45, damage-over-time reduced by 40%.

Destructo Spinner - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.45.

Devoted - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.2, fire rate reduced by 25%, recoil height improved by 30%, recoil width improved by 65%, improved accuracy.

D.N.A. - Base damage multiplier lowered from 10.5 to 2.4, damage-over-time reduced by 40%.

Ember's Purge - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.1, puddle damage set to 50% of card damage from 600%, puddle chance increased to 33%.

Flipper - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 0.25.

ION LASER - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 1, set sustained-fire damage bonus to 7.5% per stack from 20%.

Kyb's Worth - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.75 to 0.975.

P2P Networker - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.6 to 1.2.

Plasma Coil - Base damage multiplier lowered from 20 to 2.15. 

Polyaimorous - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.5 to 3, set chain damage to 40% of card damage from 50%, fixed the secondary firing mode not receiving damage buffs properly, recoil reduced by 80%.

SF Force - Base damage multiplier lowered from 7 to 1.42, set note damage to 50% of card damage from 75%, fixed alternate mode not receiving damage buff properly.

Tsunami - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.9 to 1.

Vault Hero - No change.

Westergun - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.25 to 1.2, splash radius doubled.

ASMD - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.7 to 1.3, set energy ball explosion to five times card damage from 2.5.

Binary Operator - No change.

Complex Root - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.2.

Firestorm - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.25 to 1.9, ammo cost set to 1, fireball radius set to 400.

Krakatoa - Base damage multiplier lowered from 4.25 to 1.9, educed speed of fireballs by roughly 18%.

 ┗----Rationale: Reducing the speed of the fireballs means they don't go quite as high and land closer to the volcano.

Storm - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.25 to 1.9, ammo cost set to 1, radius set to 300.

S3RV-8OS-EXECUTE - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 1.35. 

Scorpio - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1.2, reload damage doubled from 25% to 50% of card damage..

Anarchy - Set damage per stack to 10% from 30%, set accuracy penalty to 10% per stack from 5%.

 ┗----Rationale: The Anarchy's gimmick is more power for less accuracy. The accuracy penalty has been increased enough to actually matter.

Brightside - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 1.05, reload-shot damage increased by 50%.

Creeping Death - Base damage multiplier raised from 2.75 to 12, explosion damage set to 70% from 150%, status effect damage reduced by 40%, projectile speed increased by 50%, Magazine Size increased by 2, and Fire Rate by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: The damage on this thing's been increased a truckload. It's now useable both for traditional use and the "mine-laying" gimmick.

Flama Diddle - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.25.

Manic Pixie Dream Gun - No change.

Polybius - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.2 to 2.4, magazine size doubled.

 ┗----Rationale: Polybius' identity is high fire rate, and thus a higher magazine size helps to make use of that fire rate.

The Horizon - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1.2.

Dark Army - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.7 to 1.4, drone damage reduced to 25% of card damage from 166%.

TORGUE LEGENDARY GUNS
---------------------
Alchemist - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.3.

Bearcat - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 0.85, increased base Splash Radius to 300, reduce Delay between burst-volleys by 50%, reduce maximum number of bounces to 1 from 4.
 
Contained Blast - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.75, consecutive-hit bonus set to 2.5% per stack from 20%, increased magazine size by 25%.

Hotfoot Teddy - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.6. 

Juliet's Dazzle - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.35, projectile speed and acceleration doubled, adjusted description to mention the projectiles ricochet and penetrate.

Laser-Sploder - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.2 to 0.9, increased the frequency of the Laser-Sploder's projectiles to 0.65 seconds from 0.85 seconds.

Lovable Rogue - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.4 to 1.3, fixed the damage formula, increased fire rate by 50%.

Try-Bolt - Base damage multiplier lowered from 4 to 1.6, reduced delay between Burst-Volleys by 40%, reduced Recoil-Per-Shot, Recoil Height, and Recoil Width by 30% each.

Breeder - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.75, child projectile gravity increased by 76%, splash radius increased to 150.

 ┗----Rationale: The increased gravity allows the child projectiles to fall much faster, and the radius boost helps to ensure those explosions actually hit something.

Craps - No change.

Devastator - No change.

Devil's Foursum - Splash Radius set to 240 from 400, increased Projectile Speed by 20%, changed damage type to pistol, make it no longer deal self-damage, and tightened the spread of the projectiles.

Echo - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 0.75.

Girth Blaster Elite - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.3 to 0.8.

Ice Age - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.7.

Moonfire - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.25 to 1.3, critical hit damage set to 50% from 70%, amp damage set to 100% from 200%, accuracy improved by 60%, vertical recoil improved by 135%, horizontal recoil improved by 35%, weapon sway heavily reduced by 90%, equip time improved by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: This thing's meant to be a hand cannon, so it has been touched up everything to allow it to be an effective hand cannon despite the lack of a proper sight.

Occultist - Accuracy penalty removed, splash radius set to 100, main projectile speed reduced by 50%, child projectile speed increased by 140%.

 ┗----Rationale: The initial projectile being slow allows it to spawn more projectiles before it hits something.

Prompt Critical - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.3 to 0.5, sticky impact damage set to 40% of card damage from 150%.

Roisen's Thorns - Base damage multiplier lowered from 0.75 to 0.5, lowered the extra projectile damage multiplier from 1.533333 to 0.5

Scoville - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.75 to 2.3.

TNTina - Base damage multiplier raised from 2 to 4.5, Projectile Speed increased by 50%, fuse time lowered to 2 seconds, set Splash Radius to 175, increased Fire Rate by 45%.

Unkempt Harold - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 0.385, base splash radius set to 100, projectiles now split 25% earlier, projectile speed reduced by 20%.

Creamer - Base damage multiplier lowered from 8 to 0.7, lifesteal set to 1.5%.

Hive - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 0.75, ammo cost set to 3 from 4.

Nukem - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1.75, now deals radiation damage instead of kinetic damage.

 ┗----Rationale: It's a nuclear warhead launcher called the Nukem with a literal radiation symbol on the weapon's skin, in a game with nukes that actually deal radiation damage (Hammerdown Protocol and Baby Nukes). If any weapon deserves to be a radiation-element weapon, it is this one.

Plaguebearer - No change.

Quadomizer - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.8 to 2.1.

R.Y.N.A.H. - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.2 to 1.6, ammo cost set to 5 from 7, splash radius increased.

Satisfaction - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1.4, xplosion delay reduced to 1 second from 2 seconds.

Scourge - Ammo cost set to 3 from 4, splash radius increased by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Reducing the ammo cost no longer means the Plaguebearer is effectively a direct upgrade to the Scourge.

Tunguska - child projectile explosion base damage multiplier increased from 6 to 6.25.

Critical Thug - Updated description to be more accurate.

Flakker - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 2.2, ammo cost increased to 4, initial projectile speed doubled, initial projectile acceleration reduced by 33%.

 ┗----Rationale: The changes allow the initial shot to go further from the player and lessen the chance of accidentally killing oneself. Other than extreme scenarios such as Torgue-Cross Promotion used with a Splash Radius passive, one can safely use the Flakker as long as the user isn't running directly into the path of destruction.

Redline - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3 to 2.25.

Shocker - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.25 to 0.85. 

Spade - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.2, now fully automatic, fire rate reduced by 50%.

The Boring Gun - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.2, now launches initial projectile at high speed, gravity of projectile lowered considerably (shallower arc), reload speed improved by 38%, 75% critical hit damage bonus added.

 ┗----Rationale: The changes allow the Boring Gun to not be dead-weight against anything beyond point-blank range. The ideal shot is to land it right before an enemy's feet, but the critical hit damage bonus allows it to still have some use against airborne enemies.

The Lob - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.8 to 0.8.

Tiggs' Boom - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.75 to 1.2, meteor damage increased to 10 times card damage from 6, meteor radius increased 50%.

TORGUE UNIQUE GUNS
------------------
Amber Management - Base damage multiplier raised from 1 to 1.25, anger damage bonus per stack set to 10%, Happiness ammo-regenerate delay set to 10 seconds.

La Varlope - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.1 to 0.7, reduced the vertical recoil of La Varlope by 35%.

Likeable Rascal - No change.

Critical Mass - Base damage multiplier increased from 1 to 3.7 (it sounds like a bigger boost than it actually is.)

Gettleburger - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.6 to 1.1.

Black Flame - Base damage multiplier raised from 2.8 to 7, status effect damage reduced by 40%.

Chomper - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.4 to 2.5.

VLADOF LEGENDARY GUNS
---------------------
Damned - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.75 to 1.4.

Dowsing Rod - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.55 to 1.6, reduced damage of underbarrel by 35%, lowered the accuracy of the underbarrel by half.

 ┗----Rationale: The underbarrel still does sufficient damage, now it just able to spread that damage out more without increasing the splash radius.

Faisor - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.55, underbarrel ammo regeneration delay set to 0.75 seconds from 5, underbarrel regeneration rate set to .75 rounds per second, underbarrel ammo set to 8.

 ┗----Rationale: The underbarrel is one of the defining features of the Faisor. The ammo regeneration changes make it useable consistently.

Lucian's Call - Base damage multiplier lowered from 4 to 1.6.

Ogre - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 1.35, accuracy considerably improved, fire rate increased by 80%.

The Dictator - Changed how the underbarrel works to benefit better from the Double grip.

 ┗----Rationale: The Dictator's underbarrel adds four projectiles to your shots regardless of whether or not your weapon has the grip that doubles projectile count. It has been changed to increase projectile count by 2.67 times (which works out to 7 shots on a normal Dictator and 16 on a double variant.)

The Monarch - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 0.8, ammo cost set to 2, magazine size increased by 70%, changed how the underbarrel works to benefit better from the Double grip.

 ┗----Rationale: The Monarch was basically Dictator 2.0. Rather than chunking the damage, the ammo cost was increased to make it worth considering the Dictator over the Monarch at times. The Monarch underbarrel now increases to 10 and 20 projectiles for normal and double variants respectively when using the underbarrel.

Shredifier - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.2 to 1.3, Super Shredifier's underbarrel accuracy and recoil are now the same as a standard double barrel, added a second projectile to the Super Shredifier underbarrel, increased ammo cost of the Super Shredifier underbarrel by one, reduced damage of the Super Shredifier underbarrel by 25%. (x2 variants will produce four projectiles and consume three ammo.)

 ┗----Rationale: The Super Shredifier's underbarrel technically was worse than the regular double barrel for Vladof assault rifles. It has been given some tweaks to really drive home the theme of "more dakka".

Sickle - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.5 to 0.75, made the Boom Sickle have the same stats as a standard Sickle as well as properly getting boosted by Assault Rifle Damage, heavily improved accuracy and recoil, reload speed improved, magazine size increased by 12.

 ┗----Rationale: This weapon seems to be intended as a throwback to the Hammer from Borderlands 1. The various stat changes now allow it to fulfill the role of a high fire-rate shotgun-ish weapon.

Web Slinger - Cryo projectile chance set to 33%, underbarrel damage set to 50 times card damage, underbarrel splash radius set to 500, primary firing mode recoil reduced by 20%, number of underbarrel projectiles reduced to 1 from 2, set underbarrel ammo regeneration delay to 3 seconds, projectile speed tripled.

 ┗----Rationale: The underbarrel was seemingly designed to hit like a truck but never really seemed to accomplish that. The changes made to it hopefully fix that.

Firefly - Base damage multiplier lowered from 3.5 to 1.6, damage of firefiles set to 30% of card damage from 66%, speed of initial projectile increased ten-fold, child projectile initial speed reduced by 50%, child projectile max speed increased by 650%, fixed a typo in the description.

 ┗----Rationale: What this translates to is that the bullets fired from the gun go faster, the fireflies spread out less from impact, and they quickly fly after a target.

Infinity - Base damage multiplier raised from 1.2 to 1.3. 

Light Show - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.325.

Magnificent - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.5 to 1.05, added an ability that increases fire rate based on how large your magazine is. Removed accuracy and recoil penalties.

 ┗----Rationale: A giant magazine size isn't an especially interesting mechanic. So to get some use from the "Mag" in Magnificent, it has been given something that encourages going hog-wild with magazine size boosts. With enough mag size boosts you can hit a triple-digit increase in fire rate (up to 150% if you go maximum gear and skill investment on Moze.)

Miscreant - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2.3 to 1.25. 

Backburner - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.5, child projectile damage reduced by 50%.

ION CANNON - x1 ION CANNONs now consume 4 ammo while x2 ION CANNONs still consume 7.

 ┗----Rationale: X2 ION CANNONS are still going to doleing out more damage, but the reduced ammo cost of the x1 version gives it a niche of ammo efficiency.

Jericho - Base damage multiplier raised from 0.7 to 0.95, increased splash radius by 25%, made initial projectile fly slower and fly upward less, increased child projectile speed by 500% and detonate on impact instead of bouncing.

Kickcharger - Base damage multiplier lowered from 4 to 1, maximum charge damage multiplier reduced to 200% from 400%.

 ┗----Rationale: One shouldn't be able to instantly quadruple their damage by sliding. Doubling it is enough.

Mongol - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.6 to 0.8, increased splash radius by 70%.

Rocket Pod - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1 to 0.33.

Boogeyman - Skull damage reduced to 2000% card damage from 2500% card damage.

Lyuda - Base damage multiplier lowered from 1.2 to 0.6, critical hit damage bonus removed.

Septimator Prime - Base damage multiplier lowered from 2 to 1.2, starfall chance set to 20% from 14%, starfall damage set to match card damage from 200%, cooldown for starfall chance set to 1 second from 3.5 seconds, rocket launcher underbarrel delay removed, rocket underbarrel ammo regen rate set to 0.225 rounds per second, shotgun underbarrel ammo regen delay lowered to 1.4 seconds, shotgun ammo regen rate set to 0.6 rounds per second, set the meteors' damage source be Sniper Rifle instead of Shotgun.

ANSHIN LEGENDARY SHIELDS
------------------------
Asclepius - Capacity increased by 65%, recharge rate improved by 70%, recharge delay improved by 40%, damage-over-time received while shields are down reduced to effectively nothing, health regen increased to 10%, fixed nova damage not scaling with level and increased nova radius by 33%.

 ┗----Rationale: If you're going to go through hell-and-high-water to get this thing, it should be worth your effort. At least in terms of general defensive capability, it should now be top-notch.

Back Ham - Rear-damage resistance increased to 75%.

Badass Combustor - No change.

Beskar - Now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Frozen Heart - Reduced lifesteal to 5%, now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Infernal Wish - Now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Rico - Now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Rough Rider - Damage resistance increased to 50%, health bonus increased to 50%, now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Scream of Terror - Nova radius increased by 66%, capacity and delay reduced by 50%, recharge rate doubled.

Snowshoe - Reduced lifesteal to 5%, now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Super Soldier - Damage immunity reduced to a 33% damage reduction, now affects burst fire delay, and now always spawns with maximum shield parts after the first redemption of the shield.

 ┗----Rationale: In a world without things such as the anointment for triggering shield effects or the Bloodletter, full-immunity might be fine. But in order to keep people from having perpetual God-mode active, the immunity's been toned down to a decent damage reduction.

Version 0.m - Fixed amp damage not applying to multi-projectile weapons properly, now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Wattson - Disc-drop cooldown reduced to 1 second, projectile speed increased 25%.

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot - Doubled IED damage, increased IED chance to 40%, increased speed of launched IEDs by 50%, increased explosion radius 50%, reduced fuse time to 3 seconds, and made IEDs explode on impact with enemies.

 ┗----Rationale: The changes made will allow the IEDs to have a better chance of actually damaging the enemy while also reducing the risk of the wearer getting caught up in the explosions.

ANSHIN UNIQUE SHIELDS
---------------------
All-In - No change.

Initiative - Damage and resistance increased to 33%.

Moxxi's Embrace - No change.


HYPERION LEGENDARY SHIELDS
--------------------------

Re-Charger - No change.

Re-Volter - Shock damage and fire rate bonuses reduced to 25%, now affects burst fire delay, and now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

Rectifier - Damage buffed by 2333%.

Stop-Gap - Damage immunity changed to 50% damage reduction.

 ┗----Rationale: Same situation as the Super Soldier. In order to keep people from having perpetual God-mode active, the immunity's been changed from 100% damage reduction (zero damage received) to 50% damage reduction (50% less damage received.)

The Transformer - No change.

Ward - Recharge delay made longer by 100%, recharge rate improved by 50%, health regeneration increased to 5%/10%, weapon damage replaced with damage-taken reduction. Now always spawns with three Roid parts.

 ┗----Rationale: The recharge delay reduction makes it easier to maintain empty shields while the roid is active. The capacity was not reduced since it helps as a buffer while first approaching an enemy. Weapon damage was replaced since the primary reason anyone uses this shield is for melee, hence the change to damage reduction being more useful.

HYPERION UNIQUE SHIELDS
-----------------------
Brawler Unpaler - No change.

Golden Touch - No change.

Limit Break - No change.

Mr. Caffeine Shield - Now affects burst fire delay and repair time.

Plus Ultra - No change.

Red Suit - Aura damage increased by 150%.

Shooting Star - Stars no longer collide with the world.

Stinger - Nova damage reduced from Nova-Berner levels of damage to half, increased radius of novas by 43%.

 ┗----Rationale: Same story with the rest of the "Melee" gear, traditional melee should be the strongest form of melee. Stinger still has the advantage of a better delivery system as well as receiving splash bonuses.

Torch - Capacity reduced by 70%, recharge rate buffed by 75%, recharge delay improved by 10%, fireball damage increase by 80%, fireball speed increased by 200%, fireball explosion radius increased by 300%, now always spawns with maximum shield parts.

# CLASS MODS

PASSIVES
--------
Weapon Type Damage - No change.

Area-of-Effect Damage - Reduced in effectiveness (20% at level 72.)

 ┗----Rationale: For how broad an effective range of gear it could buff, the bonus was excessive. It isn't locked to an element type, manufacturer, or weapon type and thus could potentially buff a player's entire arsenal.

Weapon Magazine Size - 33% less effective than vanilla, now also affects CoV heat rate.

 ┗----Rationale: While the Artifact-based magazine size boost is the bigger culprit, that one in conjunction with this one could more than double a player's magazine size. That's a bit excessive compared to other stat bonuses.

Action Skill Cooldown - No change.

Weapon Accuracy - No change.

Weapon Reload Speed - Increased in effectiveness (30% at level 72.), now affects repair time.

Grenade Damage - No change.

Melee Damage - No change.

Shield Recharge Rate - No change.

Shield Recharge Delay - No change.

Element Resistance - No change.

Max Health - No change.

Health Regen - No change.

Shield Capacity - No change.

General Weapon Damage - No change.

Weapon Critical Damage - No change.

Received Damage Reduction - No change.

Weapon Handling - No change.

Splash Radius - Increased in effectiveness (50% at level 72.)

Grenade Radius - No change.

Grenade Capacity - Increased in effectiveness (+10 grenades at level 72.)

Weapon Fire Rate - Increased in effectiveness (30% at level 72.), now affects burst fire delay.

Weapon Charge Speed - No change.

Manufacturer Weapon Accuracy - No change.

Manufacturer Critical Damage - Reduced in effectiveness (35% at level 72.)

 ┗----Rationale: Since Manufacturer Damage is now more effective, it felt justified to reduce the damage of Manufacturer Crit. It causes less of a gap in performance between manufacturers that have a critical-boosting passive and ones that lack it.

Manufacturer Weapon Damage - Increased in effectiveness (40% at level 72.)

Manufacturer Fire Rate - Fire rate bonus made consistent across manufacturers, overall increase in effectiveness (40% at level 72.)

Manufacturer Reload Speed - Increased in effectiveness (50% at level 72.)

Torgue Weapon Projectile Speed - No change.

Action Skill Damage - No change.


NOTE ABOUT CLASS MOD CHANGES: Several skills were replaced with different skills. The reason why most of the base game class mods haven't had their skills touched is because they use the same part that regular, non-Legendary class mods use. Any exceptions to this are because only *that* class mod (in the base game) boosts the skill that has been replaced. DLC Class mods use different parts to boost their skills (even if they boost the same skill.) As to why the skill parts that can spawn on a class mod hasn't been changed, it is to prevent illegitimate class mods.

LEGENDARY GUNNER CLASS MODS
---------------------------
Bear Trooper - Replaced Explosive Punctuation with Vampyr.

 ┗----Rationale: Bear Trooper is all about getting as much up-time with the mechs active as possible. Vampyr is chosen as an option to help keep the mechs up and running.

Blast Master - No change.

Bloodletter - No change.

Eternal Flame - No change.

Flare - Replaced Stainless-Steel Bear with Desperate Measures, replaced Cloud of Lead with Stainless-Steel Bear, and replaced Means of Destruction with Deadlines.

 ┗----Rationale: Normally, Stainless-Steel Bear on the Flare can only have up to three parts. Rather than change what can spawn on the Flare, Stainless-Steel Bear has been replaced with Desperate Measures as an Iron Bear-damage boosting skill and Cloud of Lead replaced with Stainless-Steel Bear to effectively be able to have five points in Stainless-Steel Bear. Deadlines replaces Means of Destruction as a skill that moderately benefits Iron Bear.

Heat Exchanger - No change.

Sapper - Maximum lifesteal reduced to 6%, time needed to reach max lifesteal reduced by 50%.

Green Monster - Replaced Click, Click... with Redistribution and made the description more accurate.

 ┗----Rationale: The other skills present on the class mod seem to aim towards maintaining the corrosive damage bonus, so Redistribution was added to further that goal and give bullet-hose builds a leg up.

Mind Sweeper - No change.

Raging Bear - Damage and Fuel Bonuses now factor in skill/gear bonuses, Stoke the Embers replaced with Drowning in Brass.

Rocketeer - No change.


LEGENDARY OPERATIVE CLASS MODS
------------------------------
Antifreeze - Fixed a typon in the description.

Cold Warrior - Increased Damage-over-Time to 200% from 15%.

Conductor - No change.

Critical Mass - Replaced Déjà Vu with Headsman's Hand and Playing Dirty with Brain Freeze.

 ┗----Rationale: The class mod with the special effect of refilling your magazine on a critical kill also spawns with the skill that does the exact same thing. To curb this redundancy and keep in line with the theme of critical hits on this class mod, Headsman's Hand now gets boosted instead.

Executor - Reduced the critical hit damage bonus to 50%.

Hustler - Replaced Adrenaline with Violent Violence.

 ┗----Rationale: Violent Violence has been added as a means to build and cycle through Hustler stacks faster. Adrenaline did not particularly benefit the Hustler's playstyle.

Infiltrator - No change.

Seein' Dead - No change.

Shockerator - No change.

Spy - No change.

Techspert - SNTNL reset chance increased to 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: With the existence of things like the Spy and Seein' Dead allowing for immense action skill uptime, 100% chance to maintain SNTNL does not seem unreasonable.


LEGENDARY BEASTMASTER CLASS MODS
--------------------------------
3RROr Cmdl3t - Replaced Better Toys with Sic 'Em, and replaced Keep Them Safe with Fuzzy Math.

 ┗----Rationale: Sic 'Em replaces Better Toys as a means to enhance the Attack Command-centric nature of this class mod, while Fuzzy Math is a more consistent means of shield restoration compared to Keep Them Safe.

Bounty Hunter - Adjusted the description of the Bounty Hunter to be more accurate to the in-game effects.

Cosmic Stalker - No change.

DE4DEYE - Increased the high-health damage boost to 50%.

Friend-Bot - Pet damage bonus increased to 50%.

Peregrine - Replaced Ambush Predator with Grim Harvest.

R4kk P4k - No change.

Rakk Commander - Increased number of bonus Rakk charges to 3.

Roll Reversal - Replaced Eager to Impress with Go For The Eyes.

 ┗----Rationale: Go For The Eyes fits better with the theme of pet-based critical hits than Eager to Impress.

Red Fang - No change.

St4ckbot - No change.

Tr4iner - (Attempted to) increase Dominate chance to 100%, Domination duration increased to 60 seconds. Also added an optional replacement Class Mod that focuses on enabling non-Rakk Attack Action Skills to be activated frequently.

 ┗----Rationale: There isn't a great deal going for this class mod, but you can at least use the dominated enemy to draw aggro away from yourself and your pet for a while now (when it works).


LEGENDARY SIREN CLASS MODS
--------------------------
Breaker - Increased maximum damage reduction to 50%.

Death's Blessings - Blessing orb speed increased by 200%, Gun Damage changed to General Damage, damage changed back to factor in skill/gear boosts, damage bonus reduced to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The change to general damage means everything you do is going to deal more damage, including action skills and Remnant itself. This will hopefully lead to more uptime on this class mod's special effect.

Dragon - Replaced Remnant with Personal Space.

 ┗----Rationale: The Dragon's special effect only triggers when a Melee kill is made. To facilitate that, Personal Space (which has been changed to boost Melee damage as well) has been added.

Elementalist - Replaced Wildfire with Anima and increased the Damage-over-Time's damage by 1750%.

Golden Rule - No change.

Kensei - Increased bonus damage duration to 10 seconds.

Muse - No change.

Nimbus - Increased cloud damage by 20%.

Phasezerker - No change.

Spiritual Driver - Gun damage bonus now also affects slide damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Like with the Violent Momentum change. It adds a bit of extra variety and makes logical sense that something moving fast hurts when it hits something.

Stone - Rush stack chance increased to 20%.



# ARTIFACTS

PASSIVES
--------
Weapon Type Damage - No change.

Area-of-Effect Damage - Reduced in effectiveness (25% at level 72), no longer increases splash radius.

 ┗----Rationale: Already covered in the Splash Damage notes in the Class Mod section. The radius removal helps stop or diminish issues with items such as the Complex Root or Sidewinder as well as making the actual passive stat for splash radius more valuable (which has been buffed to help compensate the loss of radius boosts with this stat.)

Weapon Magazine Size - Reduced in effectiveness (25% at level 72), now also affects CoV heat rate.

Action Skill Cooldown - No change.

Weapon Accuracy - Primary and Secondary now boost the same stuff (accuracy spread, recoil height/width, recoil-per-shot, max accuracy.)

-------------------

Moxxi's Endowment - Now doubles all experience obtained in combat (includes other experience boosts.) Also added an optional replacer that changes it to enhance shield recharge rate and delay at the cost of capacity.

Otto Idol - No change.

Phoenix Tears - Fight-for-your-life duration and fight-for-your-life movement speed increased by 50% each, 10% health regeneration per second added.

 ┗----Rationale: The main effect of this artifact is made redundant by a simple Guardian Perk, so it has been given some other bonuses to aid in survivability.

Pull Out Method - Cooldown reduced to 3 seconds.

Rocket Boots - Increased rokcet damage by 300%.

Safeguard - No change.

Static Charge - Made the description of the ability more accurate.

The Pearl of Ineffable Knowledge - Damage for the first 15 stacks increased to 3.33%, damage for the final stack reduced to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Instead of gaining a pitiful amount of damage for the first few shots, now you gain a decent chunk of damage before getting the final bonus.

# ANOINTMENTS

Many of the anointsments below have been adjusted to "now factor in skill and gear bonuses." What this means for example is that before if you had 1000% Weapon Damage from skills and gear in an unmodded game of Borderlands 3, and used the 100% weapon damage anointment it'd only be 1100% total. With it factoring in gear and skill boosts however, the 25% Weapon Damage anointment causes that 1000% weapon damage to become 1250%.

GENERAL ANOINTMENTS
-------------------
150/90 - Reduced to 70%.

U-Rad - Reduced to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: It may seem like a tiny number, but by making it affect gears and skills each stack now has slightly greater effect than the one before it. It ends up being notably stronger than 25% at 100 stacks.

# GUNNER SKILLS

Updated the descriptions of many skills to either mention Iron Cub whenever Iron Bear is mentioned or otherwise be more accurate to the skill's in-game effects.

SHIELD OF RETRIBUTION
----------------------
Selfless Vengeance - Increased Incendiary Bonus to 4% per point, increased bonus seconds-per-point to 2 from 1.

Security Bear - No change.

Armored Infantry - Changed the damage type to global damage instead of gun damage and added Mayhem-scaled gun-damage.

Drowning in Brass - Iron Bear damage boost changed to a type that affects both arms (same as Stainless Steel Bear's), now affects burst fire delay.

Thin Red Line - No change.

Vladof Ingenuity - No change.

Full Can of Whoop-Ass - Now displays the damage reduction it has.

Experimental Munitions - No change.

Behind the Iron Curtain - Increased recharge rate and delay bonuses to 15% per point.

Desperate Measures - No change.

Phalanx Doctrine - No change.

Force Feedback - Increased shield restore to 15%.

Tenacious Defense - Made the damage bonus affect most types of damage as well as factor in gear and skill bonuses.

DEMOLITION WOMAN
----------------
Fire in the Skag Den - Increased fire damage to 4% per point.

Deadlines - No change.

Grizzled - The amount of Action Skill Cooldown Time reduced has been adjusted to accomodate the changed Iron bear duration and cooldown changes.

Means of Destruction - No change.

Torgue Cross-Promotion - Increased the splash damage bonus to 7% per point.

Stainless Steel Bear - Increased Iron Bear damage per point to 6%.

Pull the Holy Pin - No change.

Auto Bear - Increased self-destruct damage by 300%.

Vampyr - Reduced Lifesteal to 1% per point.

Why Can't I Carry All These Grenades - Replaced grenade capacity with grenade regeneration, added a 10%-per-point Grenade Damage bonus.

 ┗----Rationale: Unless the skill was made to add a copious amount of grenades, nobody would want this. Grenade damage is a nice incentive to pick this skill up, and replacing grenade capacity with grenade regeneration makes it easier to maintain a supply of grenades that can't hit multiple times (grenades like the Cloning Maddening Tracker or Ghast Call are often able to semi-maintain their own grenade count by themselves with Means of Destruction.)

To The Last - No change.

Explosive Punctuation - Increased duration to 5 seconds, reduced the cooldown bonus to 5% from 8%, made the cooldown bonus factor in skill and gear boosts, and added 5% bonus movement speed per point.

Short Fuse - No change.

BOTTOMLESS MAGS
---------------
Cloud of Lead - Increased fire damage to 4% per point.

Dakka Bear - No change.

Matched Set - Added 1.5% gun damage per point (it doesn't display the percentage in the same way the magazine size and heat reduction do, it's the total bonus.)

Stoke the Embers - No change.

Redistribution - No change.

Scrappy - Increased the damage bonus to 7% per point.

Rushin' Offensive - Reduced lifesteal to 1%.

Scorching RPM's - Increased Iron Bear Damage per point to 7%, now affects burst fire delay.

The Iron Bank - Added a 5%-per-point bonus to reload speed/repair time, made it also affect heat per shot.

Specialist Bear - Reduced the damage bonus to 30%.

 ┗----Rationale: 60% damage bonus is certainly a boon for damage but it effectively kills the desire to mix and match weapon types for versatility. 30% is still enough to merit investing in for more damage but not so much that you wouldn't want to try combinations of different weapons.

Some for the Road - A second point in Some For The Road now increases duration by 5 seconds.

Click, Click... - Reduced maximum bonus to 50% and made it factor in gear and skill bonuses.

Forge - Increased bonus to 12.5%.

Never Gonna Give You Up - No change.

Feature Creep - No change.

Limit Break - No change.

Superior Firepower - No change.

Running on Fumes - No change.

ACTION SKILLS/AUGMENTS
----------------------
Iron Bear - Reduced Duration and Cooldown to 60 seconds, increased stomp damage by 250% per level (basically meaning that low-level Iron Bear has the same stomp damage as before while high-level Iron Bear has stronger stomps.)

 ┗----Rationale: With a reduction in the cooldown time needed to regain Iron Bear, Moze has more access to anointments and is less reliant on Topped Off. For the reduction in duration as a balancing factor since cooldown was lowered, in a choice between maintaining Iron Bear's power or Iron Bear's duration the mech's power was chosen to be more useful to more builds instead of having a long-lasting but weaker mech.

Iron Cub - No change.

Railgun - No change.

Hell on Rails - No change.

Capacitive Armature - Reduced splinter damage to 40% from 70%.

Corrosive Sabot - Reduced initial damage to 85% from 97%, reduced explosion damage to 50% from 60%.

Bear Fist - Increased damage by 347%, reduced fuel consumption by 70%.

 ┗----Rationale: For something that can only be used point-blank range, it should pack a wallop and have better efficiency than what it had before. 

Wild Swing - No change.

Close the Distance - Reduced cooldown between shots to 2 seconds from 3, reduced fuel consumption by 70%.

Shockhammer - No change.

Vanquisher Rockets - No change.

Active Tracking - Reduced the time needed between homing locks to 0.15 seconds from 0.25 seconds.

Target Softening - No change.

Hammerdown Protocol - No change.

V-35 Grenade Launcher - Improved fuel consumption by 25%.

Shaped Charge - No change.

Musical Chairs - Increased damage of singularity grenade to 0.4 from 0.17, now deploys a singularity every 5th grenade.

Lock and Speedload - No change.

Salamander Flamethrowers - Increased damage by 250%, increased fire rate to 8 from 3, reduced damage-over-time by 35%, adjusted fuel consumption to account for increased fire rate.

 ┗----Rationale: Similar to the Bear Fist rationale but to a lesser extent. Limited range should equate a better performance within that range.

Fuel Economy - Adjusted fuel consumption to account for the above changes, fixed the display for movement speed being double the actual value, increased the actual movement speed bonus to 30%, and increased duration to 4 seconds.

Chemical Warfare - No change.

Molten Roar - Increased damage by 242%.

Miniguns - No change.

Let Off Some Steam - No change.

General Winter - No change.

Exploding. Bullets. - No change.

# OPERATIVE SKILLS

DOUBLED AGENT
-------------
Synchronicity - Added a bonus to Action Skill damage.

Praemunitus - Made it affect Heat-per-Shot.

Borrowed Time - No change.

Donnybrook - Changed the health regeneration from missing health to total health.

Fractal Frags - No change.

Duct Tape Mod - Removed Gun-Splash Immunity. Grenade immunity remains. Fixed the skill description saying it had a cooldown of 4 seconds instead of 8.

 ┗----Rationale: Duct Tape mod making you immune to your own grenades makes sense due to the fact it may suddenly spawn a grenade right in your face when you're up close and personal to an enemy. Splash immunity just dumbs down Zane's gameplay and leads to things like Complex Root spam.

Quick Breather - No change.

Pocket Full of Grenades - Added bonus grenade damage to the same extent as the grenade regeneration.

Old-U - No change.

Supersonic Man - No change.

Like a Ghost - Increased base dodge chance to 8.33% per point from 5%, reduced bonus dodge chance to 3.33% from 5%, made it stack only once.

 ┗----Rationale: Reducing the stack count to one means the base bonus for the skill can be increased to a desireable level without making it too strong if it could stack twice.

Boom. Enhance. - Increased the clone health bonus per grenade to 100% and added accuracy and handling bonuses. Made the fire rate/reload speed bonuses affect burst fire delay and repair time.

Trick of the Light - Changed Cryo Damage back to Shock Damage.

Double Barrel - Changed gun damage to general damage and reduced damage bonus to 20%.

HITMAN
-------------
Violent Speed - No change.

Cold Bore - Reduced the bonus cryo damage to 10% per point.

Violent Momentum - Gun damage curve reduced past regular walking speed, now also increases slide damage, added Action-Skill-damage Mayhem Scaling.

 ┗----Rationale: If an old man slides into your kneecaps at hyperspeed, logically speaking it should hurt more than if he slides into you at a brisk jog. It also opens up some fun avenues for alternate damage.

Cool Hand - Now also affects repair time.

Drone Delivery - Reduced cooldown to 10 seconds.

Salvation - Reduced lifesteal to 0.2% per point from 2%, allowed grenades to receive lifesteal fm this skill.

Seein' Red - No change.

Violent Violence - Fixed burst-fire delay being increased by this skill.

Playing Dirty - No change.

Good Misfortune - No change.

UNDER COVER
-----------
Adrenaline - No change.

Ready for Action - No change.

Brain Freeze - No change.

Stiff Upper Lip - Increased damage resistance, now increases elemental damage.

Rise to the Occasion - No change.

Distributed Denial - No change.

Refreshment - Reduced lifesteal to 1% per point.

Calm, Cool, Collected - Increased health regeneration to 5%.

Nerves of Steel - Increased accuracy and handling bonuses to 2.66% per point, added 1.5%-per-point critical hit damage.

Confident Competence - Changed gun damage to all-purpose damage and increased the maximum damage bonus to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Zane's got tons of gun damage, but not a great deal of other damage. A 50% increase to all damage should make it worthwhile to reach this capstone.

THE PROFESSIONAL
----------------
Man of Focus - No change.

Renegade - Increased health regeneration to 1.5% per point.

Deja Vu - No change.

Headman's Hand - No change.

Tunnel Vision - No change.

Commitment - No change.

Fugitive - No change.

Domino Effect - Fixed burst-fire delay being increased by this skill instead of decreased, made it affect repair time.

Art of War - Reduced max stack amount to 3, increased damage per point to 6.66%.

 ┗----Rationale: Most people aren't going to waste time activating ten Action Skills for a one-time increase to damage. Three is a more reasonable number.

Sheer Will - No change.

Eraser - No change.

Our Man Flynt - No change.

ACTION SKILLS/AUGMENTS
----------------------
Barrier - Reduced cooldown to 16 seconds from 24 seconds, increase amp damage to 40% on the ground (28% while held).

 ┗----Rationale: The increase in amp damage and the reduction of Lifesteal should encourage more usage of the Barrier.

Charged Relay - Replaced reload speed with fire rate, increase maximum movement speed to 40%, increased maximum fire rate to 35% and now affects burst fire delay.

 ┗----Rationale: Two augments in the same tree shouldn't be boosting the exact same stat. Thus the reload speed has been replaced with fire rate.

Nanites or Some Shite - Increased maximum health regen to 10%, increase reload speed bonus to 33% and now affects repair time, increase shield delay bonus to 50%.

All-Rounder - No change.

Deterrence Field - No change.

ACTION SKILLS/AUGMENTS
----------------------
Rakk Attack - Increased damage by 80% and added a note to the skill description mentioning that Splash bonuses apply to this action skill and its augments.

Rakk Open a Cold One - No change.

Falconer's Feast - No change.

Flock n' Load - No change.

Rakkcelerate - No change.

Gamma Burst - No change.

Atomic Aroma - Increased aura damage by roughly 300%.

Endurance - Increased time earned per kill to 5 seconds.

Burst Aid - Increased heal regeneration to 33%.

Fade Away - No change.

Guerillas in the Mist - No change.

Not My Circus - No change.

Until You Are Dead - No change.

Unblinking Eye - No change.

Gravity Snare - Reduced cooldown to 16 seconds from 36, increased pulse frequency to once every second from 4 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: Gravity Snare isn't doing Fl4k any favors for damage, but it can at least be turned into a good crowd control skill. With it pulsing every second it effectively disables enemies for the duration of the skill, and the lowered cooldown means it it more readily available than something like Red Fang/Gamma Burst.

Forage - Drop amount and booster shield-restoration reduced due to increasing the frequency of gravity pulses increasing the frequency of producing items.

Wide Net - No change.

Trap Card - Changed description to mention that the trap is free when deployed while entering FFYL.

Blind With Anger - No change.

PETS
----
Increased base pet melee damage, lunge damage, ranged damage, and skill damage by 200%.

Increased base pet health by 40%.

Improved attack command cooldown by 25%.

 ┗----Rationale: Attack Command is one of those things seldom used because you can only use them once in a while and tend to forget about it in the heat of combat. A reduction in cooldown should help remedy that.

Spiderant Centurion - No change.

Spiderant Scorcher - Increased aura damage by 233%.

Spiderant Countess - Increased damage reduction bonus to 10%.

Guard Skag - No change.

# SIREN SKILLS

FIST OF THE ELEMENTS
--------------------
Anima - Updated description to mention that it does not work with the Cold Hearted augment.

Wildfire - Increased spread chance to 10% per point.

Dread - No change.

Indiscriminate - Added a note saying that this skill gets scaled by Mayhem Mode.

Conflux - No change.

Forceful Expression - Updated the description to be more accurate.

MYSTICAL ASSAULT
----------------
Do Harm - Reduced the maximum amount of stacks to 50, doubled the effectiveness of each stack.

 ┗----Rationale: While this skill can reach up to 99 stacks under certain conditions, those conditions are not realistic in practice. Rather than funneling more damage into the already bloated Phase-skill anointments to make Amara's Action Skills more viable at endgame, Do Harm has been tweaked instead. Hence the maximum count has been reduced to 50 while the effectiveness has been doubled to equal the same strength it would have previously with 99 stacks. This change also narrows the gap between the Phasezerker class mod and other class mods such as the Stone for Action-Skill oriented builds. Same applies to Violent Tapestry.

Fast Hand(s) - Added Action-Skill-damage Mayhem Scaling and now affects repair time.

Violent Tapestry - Reduced the maximum amount of stacks to 50, doubled the effectiveness of each stack.

Alacrity - Now affects repair time.

Transcend - No change.

BRAWL
-----
Root to Rise - No change.

Personal Space - Made it also affect Melee damage and Phaseslam damage.

Clarity - No change.

Arms Deal - No change.

Samsara - Fixed the health regeneration being based on missing health.

Helping Hand(s) - No change.

Mindfulness - Replaced the Shield Recharge Delay with 0.5% Damage Resistance per point.

 ┗----Rationale: There are two primary reasons to use Mindfulness, and neither of them especially benefit from less recharge delay; going super speed with a Driver for damage (meaning you're constantly hurting yourself), or using it as a gap-closer in a Melee build (in which case lower delay actually hampers Roid shields). A small amount of damage resistance per stack is beneficial to both styles of play instead of slightly aiding one and hampering another.

Find Your Center - No change.

Vigor - Increase movement speed bonus to 5% per point.

One With Nature - No change.

Do unto Others - Reduced cooldown to 3 seconds, increased damage by 33%, added a note saying that this skill gets scaled by Mayhem Mode.

Atman - No change.

Clear the Mind - Increased the duration to 12 seconds.


ACTION SKILLS/AUGMENTS
----------------------
One of Amara's bigger issues is a reliance on her Action Skills but lacking the cooldown to use them frequently without the use of things such as Expedite or Topped Off. Since Topped Off has been nerfed and having viable options other than Expedite is a good thing (especially if you lack the Designer's Cut DLC), most of her Action Skills have received a substantial reduction in cooldown length.


Phaseslam - Increased damage by 315%, lowered cooldown to 24 seconds. Added a note to the skill description mentioning that Splash bonuses apply to this action skill.

Fracture - Increased damage by 315%, lowered cooldown to 22 seconds. Added a note to the skill description mentioning that Splash bonuses apply to this action skill.

Downfall - Made Downfall's slam damage and radius the same as Phaseslam, increased the damage of the beam 1000%, lowered cooldown to 28 seconds, increased the flight speed by 25%. Added a note to the skill description mentioning that Splash bonuses apply to this action skill.
