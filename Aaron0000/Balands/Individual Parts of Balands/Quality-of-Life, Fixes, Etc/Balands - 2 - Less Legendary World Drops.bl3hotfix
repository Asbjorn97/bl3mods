### (The mod's name is pronounced the same as the word "balance".)
###
### Borderlands 3 is a good time, but there are some parts that leave room
### for questioning. Certain aspects of endgame like skill, pet, and shield
### damage being multiplied dozens of times over without being mentioned
### in-game, the overwhelming importance of anointments, and lots of gear
### requiring triple-digit buffs in order to deal with a five-digit boost to
### enemy health makes it almost impossible to keep things relatively
### balanced during playthroughs. And then there's the stuff that can't
### even perform well at the lowest levels of play. So I've tried my hand 
### at putting some more balance in the Borderlands.
###
### This mod can used with any normal save file without needing to change anything, the only thing you may need to change when you return to normal-play is your Mayhem Mode modifiers if you change them while the mod is active.
