S&S Replaces CoV
===========

Replaces the CoV manufacturer with S&S Munitions from the first game. Includes stat changes that increase magazine size for assault rifles and heavy weapons, and decrease damage, but increase elemental damage and chance. Also includes UI changes that change the manufacturer icon and text referencing the manufacturer.

Note: The hotfix only contains stat changes and UI changes. If you would like the weapon color changes, download the .pak file at the [Nexus Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/231)
