Equal Character Gear Chance
===========================

Adjusts the character-specific weighting so that character-specific gear (such
as COMs, customizations, and anointments) should drop at about equal rates,
instead of being weighted towards the currently- active characters.  This is
basically the opposite of my No Wasted Equipment mod.

This is really only intended for my own mod-testing purposes, and might have
some unintended consequences when used in ordinary gameplay, so beware!  COMs,
customizations, and character-specific anointments are likely to start
overpowering all other loot.
