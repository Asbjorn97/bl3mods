Fast Levelling
==============

This is a collection of mods which can be used to level up a character
super fast.  Obviously if you're looking to just become max level, you
can use a save editor nowadays, but this is useful for testing
progression-related mods.

This comes in three variants:

* **Insane** - Gives you about a whole level per kill, even beyond
  level 50.  Early levels will probably have you jumping multiple levels
  per kill.
* **Fast** - Compared to "Insane," this will be much more sedate, for
  fine-tuning purposes, but it'll still be a heck of a lot faster than
  the base game.
* **Faster** - This is inbetween the two.
