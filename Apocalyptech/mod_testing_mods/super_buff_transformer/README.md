Super Buff: Transformer
=======================

Cheat mod which gives the Transformer shield the following:

* Zero recharge delay
* Extraordinarily fast recharge

A level 1 Transformer will easily last you throughout an entire story
runthough, and probably into Mayhem levels after that.

This is basically just what I use for testing out mods, when I don't
want to be bothered by combat.  Note that this will *not* protect you
from hardcoded insta-death scenarios, of course.
