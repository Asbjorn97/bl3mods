Arms Race Cheat
===============

This is a cheat mod to make Arms Race completely trivial, used by myself for
testing out mods while in Stormblind Complex, so I can ignore combat entirely.
It seemed easier to do this than figure out a way to get my usual mod-testing
gear into that map.

This does a few things:
 * Reduces the damage you take, so you're basically invulnerable
 * Decreases enemy health severely, so you can one-shot them with basically anything
 * Increases the first Murdercane timer to six hours
