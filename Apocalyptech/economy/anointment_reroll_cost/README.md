Anointment Re-Roll Cost
=======================

This is collection of cheat mods which allow you to decide how much eridium
the re-roll machine (next to Earl's, in Sanctuary) costs, instead of the
default 250 Eridium.  The available values, depending on which mod you use,
are:

* Free
* 1
* 10
* 25
* 50
* 100
* 150
* 200

All *real* credit for this goes to Nexus-Mistress, who found the
proper attribute to use after I'd failed to do so myself!
