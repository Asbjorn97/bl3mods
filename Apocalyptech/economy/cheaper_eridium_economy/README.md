Cheaper Eridium Economy
=======================

Makes two changes to the Eridium economy in the game:

1. Customizations at Earl's shop on Sanctuary will be far cheaper
2. Eridium slot machine price will be lower

I haven't yet figured out lowering the costs in the Vault Veterans
machine, but it's been quite awhile since I've looked.  Combined with
the other mods I use, this completely destroys the Eridium economy
entirely, so it's a bit silly, but eh.

The slot machine scaling is identical to the scaling also done in
my Cheaper Slots mod.

- Figure out Vault Veterans price scaling
