Better Slots
============

Improved results for all slot machines -- will always get a reward, and
never any loaded grenades.  Customizations won't drop too often, since
they just just the same pools as the global customization drops.

A bit silly, since the slot machines in BL3 don't actually drop anything
that can't be found quite easily in the world, but whatever.
