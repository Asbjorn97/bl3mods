Mission Reward Randomizer
=========================

Like my Boss Drop Randomizer mod, this randomizes all mission rewards, so you
won't actually know what you're getting for completing missions.  You *will*
receive the same *type* of item that you'd expect, so if a mission gives you
a shotgun, you'll still get a shotgun.

It's recommended to use my Expanded Legendary Pools mod with this, to give
you a wider variety of rewards

Note that customization pools are left alone, so missions which reward
skins/heads will still reward those cosmetics.
