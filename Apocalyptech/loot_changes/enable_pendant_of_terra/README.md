Enable Pendant of Terramorphous Artifact
========================================

Pendant of Terramorphous is a legendary artifact which is technically in
the game data, but was never actually added into the game proper (and had
clearly never gotten as far as playtesting/balancing).  It provides a
constant health regeneration, though the "vanilla" regeneration rate is
exceptionally weak and may as well not even be there.

This mod adds it in as a valid artifact, and fixes up the regeneration rate
so that it's an actually-useful artifact.  This fixed rate hasn't really seen
much playtesting, so it could be that it's still too weak, or of course it
could even be too strong.  If you have opinions, please contact me, and I'd
be happy to tweak it!

TODO
====

- As I mentioned, it needs playtesting, and the regen rate could use tweaking.
