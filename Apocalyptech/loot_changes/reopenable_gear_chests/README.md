Reopenable Gear Chests
======================

Prevents red and white chests throughout the game from remembering their
opened state between level loads, so they can be re-openable without
having to go out to the main menu (or waiting for the timers to elapse).

This does *not* affect explicitly single-use chests, such as the one in
Lilith's quarters.  Those chests will continue to be only usable once per
game.

**Note:** Any red chest timer information currently stored in your savegame
will still apply when you go into the game, even with this mod active.
You can either wait for those timers to expire as usual, or just quit out
to the main menu once to clear it out.

**Mod Compatibility Info:** This mod is a more powerful version of my
Red Chest Timer Reset mod.  There's no *problem* with having both in your
mod list, but Red Chest Timer Reset is a bit pointless if you're already
running this one.
