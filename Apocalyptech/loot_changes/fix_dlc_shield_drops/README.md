Fix DLC Shield Drops
====================

Most enemies in DLC2 (Guns, Love and Tentacles) won't actually drop
shields, and some enemies in DLC4 (Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic
Fustercluck) won't ever drop non-DLC4-specific shields.  This fixes
that for standard enemies, though doesn't bother doing so with badasses
yet.  I'm not entirely sure how widespread the DLC4 issue is -- it seems
that enemies in Castle Crimson are probably unaffected, but some enemies
in Sapphire's Run *are*, for instance.

The fix for DLC4 is also included in my DLC Loot De-Emphasizer mod, since
it serves that purpose as well.
