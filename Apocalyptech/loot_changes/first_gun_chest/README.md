First Gun Chest
===============

This is actually two different mods, both of which alter the contents of the
very first gun chest found in Covenant Pass, when starting the game.  In
the vanilla game, this just contains one Vladof pistol.  The variants:

* **Full Loadout** - The chest will now contain two pistols, a shield, a grenade
  mod, a COM, and an artifact.  You'll need to be using my Early Bloomer mod to
  make use of the COM and Artifact (that or use a save editor to unlock those
  inventory slots)
* **Testing Gear** - This is mostly for my own purposes, but makes the chest
  contain a Crader's EM-P5 and a Transformer shield.  You'll need to be using
  my Early Bloomer mod to see those, and this is intended to be used with my
  Super Buff mods (from my mod-testing folder).

As mentioned above, you'd probably want to be using my Early Bloomer mod to
be able to make use of these; otherwise the COM+artifact might not spawn, and
you also might be locked into early-game manufacturers and parts for the
pistols, too.
