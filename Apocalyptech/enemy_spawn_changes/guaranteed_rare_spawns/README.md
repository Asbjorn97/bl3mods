Guaranteed Rare Spawns
======================

This mod attempts to make all rare spawns in the game always spawn at
100%, with just a few exceptions I couldn't figure out.  The rare vehicle
spawns throughout the base game have also been adjusted to be far more
common as well, though they aren't 100% themselves.

This mod isn't needed for base-game rare spawns anymore, as Gearbox has
officially upped those spawnrates to 100%, but this does do the vehicle
spawns, as mentioned, and also DLC rare spawns (which have not been buffed
to 100% by Gearbox).

There are two known exceptions at the moment:

* Brood Mother, in Pyre of Stars, apparently spawns based partially on how
  many mobs you've killed outside her lair?
* Skagzilla's spawnrate is unaffected.

TODO
====

- Figure out Brood Mother and Skagzilla
