Sizemod
=======

This is a collection of mod which attempts to scale all NPCs (enemies or
otherwise) by various factors, to make them very small, or very large.
This will almost certainly be game-breaking in some circumstances, so let
me know if anything really dire happens with any of these.

There are a number of options available:

* Tiny: 0.4x
* Smol: 0.7x
* Big: 2.0x
* Huge: 3.0x
* Giant: 5.0x

To use a custom value, edit the generation script to add more, and
re-run it.

Note that characters who are interacting with the environment in some way,
like typing on a console, or leaning up against a wall, will generally
be unaffected by this change, as the scene-based animation seems to override
the size scaling.
