P2P Networker Element Fix
=========================

The P2P Networker is an unfinished gun which can't be legitimately acquired
in BL3, but has a valid balance and can be spawned in.  (It's included in
my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, for instance.)  One quirk of the gun is that
it's a Maliwan gun but without a secondary element, but you can still try and
switch to the secondary element to see an amusing "gun team plz fix name"
message.

This mod correctly adds in a secondary element to the gun, so it'll function
like other Maliwan weapons.

**Note:** This only applies to freshly-spawned P2P Networkers.  Any P2P Networker
already in your inventory (or item code from a previous gun) will still only
have the single element.  It needs to be a fresh spawn, with this mod active.
