Better Maliwan Charge Time
==========================

Improves the charge time of all Maliwan weapons.

Pistols and SMGs receive a 50% improvement, shotguns get 60%, and snipers will always
be instant-fire (though the models which fire on *releasing* the trigger will still do so).

This has been updated through DLC6 (Director's Cut).

TODO
====

- It might make sense to also include a few non-Maliwan guns which have similar charging
  mechanics
