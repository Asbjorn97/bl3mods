Nerf OP Gear
============

Nerfs a bunch of weapons which are extremely OP when used in Normal mode.
For the most part, these are weapons which are intended for use at Mayhem
10, so anyone using them in Normal (or while using my Mayhem Level Cheats
or Decreased Mayhem Enemy Scaling mods), they're just too much.  So, they've
gotten nerfed down.  The weapons currently included in here are:

* Anarchy: `1` -> `0.4`
* Backburner: `2` -> `1.7`
* Kaoson: `1.6` -> `1`
* Krakatoa: `4.25` -> `2.5`
* NoPewPew: `1.1` -> `0.15`
* O.P.Q. System: `1.8` -> `1`
* Plaguebearer: `1.1` -> `0.9`
* Reflux: `1.75` -> `1.5`
* Sand Hawk: `1.5` -> `0.5`
* Skullmasher: `0.5` -> `0.3`
* The Monarch: `1.6` -> `0.7`
* Wedding Invitation Ricochet Damage: `2.928` -> `1`
* Yellowcake: `1.75` -> `1`

TODO
====

- This needs balancing, and I'm sure there are other weapons which could
  use inclusion in here as well.
