Provocateur COM (Unreleased Ixora Operative COM)
================================================

The Designer's Cut DLC (Ixora) data included an unreleased/unfinished
second Operative COM, to go along with the Spy COM.  With just a bit of
tweaking, the unreleased mod can be fixed up to operate as-advertised
on the COM text, so that's what this mod does.  The COM does not have a
name defined anywhere in the game data, so this mod assigns it the name
'Provocateur'.

From the on-card COM description:

    Whenever Zane scores a Critical Hit he has a 10% chance to activate all
    kill skills twice.  Additionally, his kill skills last an additional 8
    seconds.

This mod makes use of a naming part taken from another unreleased bit of
gear, the 'Portals and Shite,' a completely-unimplemented named Atlas
AR which has nothing special about it apart from the name.  If any other
mods end up using the Portals and Shite naming part as well, this mod
won't be fully compatible with it.

This mod also adds the Provocateur to the relevant drop pools, so it
should be gettable from any source which would ordinarily drop the Spy.
The probability of Spy was dropped a little bit to make room for the
new COM, without diluting the rest of the pools too much (Spy and
Provocateur are equally-likely drops).

**Notes on Mod Compatibility:**

If using this mod along with DLC Loot De-Emphasizer, make sure that this
mod is in your list *before* DLC Loot De-Emphasizer, otherwise the
Provocateur COM will remain a fixed drop.  (If using these two in
conjunction, you'll need to use a mod like Expanded Legendary Pools, in
order to get Provocateur drops.)

If using this mod along with Expanded Legendary Pools, make sure that this
mod is in mod list *after* Expanded Legendary Pools, in order to
correctly get added to that mod's updated pools.
