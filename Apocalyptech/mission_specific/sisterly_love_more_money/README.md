Sisterly Love: More Money
=========================

This buffs up the amount of cash you get from the malfunctioning slot
machines during the DLC2 mission "Sisterly Love."  They're honestly still
rather anemic -- it doesn't look like there's a great way to buff them
up significantly.  Increasing the quantity of drops too much introduces
a super-noticeable freeze in the game while the engine populates all
the floating cash, so we can only do so much here.
