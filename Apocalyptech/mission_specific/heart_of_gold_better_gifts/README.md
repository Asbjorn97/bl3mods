Heart of Gold: Better Gifts
===========================

In the DLC1 mission "Heart of Gold," I've always felt like it'd be less
pathetic if Joy turned out to be sitting on a huge fortune or something, so
this bumps up the gifts you get at the end of Heart of Gold.  This doesn't
really make a vast difference, really, but it does up the quantity of drops by
4x, and introduces Eridium stacks to the gifts.
