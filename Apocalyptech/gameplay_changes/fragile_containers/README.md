Fragile Containers
==================

Makes the majority of containers in the game openable by taking damage from any
source -- guns, grenades, barrel explosions, etc.

Some containers in the game are made of sterner stuff than the rest, and can't
be shot open.  These are the ones that'll have to be opened the boring old-fashioned
way:
 - Eridium-crystal-encrusted white chests
 - Typhon dead drops
 - "Arena" chests in the Circles of Slaughter
 - Safes holding Vic's memory ECHOes in Ascension Bluff, during Head Case
 - White chests in the weapons depot in Meridian Metroplex, during
   Hostile Takeover
 - Some white chests in Atlas HQ
 - A white chest or two in Devil's Razor
 - The two eridium chests inside the vault in Tazendeer Ruins
 - The ammo chests in the Hemovorous arena, in Darkthirst Dominion
 - All the chests in Arm's Race (in Stormblind Complex)
 - The majority of containers in Midnight's Cairn and Minos Prime
   (Maliwan and Guardian Takedowns)
 - Some white chests in Heck Hole
 - The mask-containing chests in Villa Ultraviolet
 - Portal Chests on Xylourgos
 - The red chest reward at the end of Call of the Deep, in Skittermaw Basin
 - Eista's arena reward chests in Skittermaw Basin
 - Most "Good Prospects" chests in Bounty of Blood
 - Vendor cash registers in the Vestige market
 - Loot chests in the bank vault in Vestige (DLC-end rewards)
 - The white+red chests in Vaulthalla

Note that Eridian ammo chests don't always take kindly to being shot and may not
open all the way sometimes.  The ammo inside should still be pick-uppable, though!
