Fragile Eridium Clusters
========================

Allows Eridium clusters (and jars) to be broken apart by gunfire or any
other source of damage, instead of requiring the Eridian Resonator to be
unlocked.  As such, allows the collection of Eridium from the environment
to be done from the very start of the game, without any save editing.

TODO
====

* I'd like to be able to break apart "frozen" Anointed enemies with regular
  damage as well, but I've had zero luck figuring out how to do it.  I suspect
  that might be hardcoded in the engine instead of via game objects, though
  perhaps I just haven't looked in the right places yet.

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - January 24, 2023
 * Initial release
