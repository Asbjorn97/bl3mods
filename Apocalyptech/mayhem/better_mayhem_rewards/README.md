Better Mayhem Rewards
=====================

This buffs up the XP gains even more in Mayhem modes, and increases Anointment part
probabilities.  In later Mayhem levels, anointments should be guaranteed.

This mod has *not* been looked at too closely lately, and pre-dates the Mayhem 2.0
overhaul, so it's possible that it could use some tweaking.  The lower Mayhem
level anointment rates may even be *worse* now than what GBX has adjusted things to.

TODO
====

- Need to go over the game data again and see if this mod needs adjusting.
