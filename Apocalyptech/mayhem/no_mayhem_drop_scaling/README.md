No Mayhem Drop Scaling
======================

Ordinarily, drops start improving in quality as you go up in Mayhem levels.  This
removes that extra scaling entirely.  This exists primarily because I use Better
Loot to improve droprates overall, and with the native built-in Mayhem loot
improvements, the quality at higher Mayhem levels was far too much even for me.

With this mod enabled, though, your drop quality should be the same whether you're
in Normal, TVHM, or any Mayhem mode.  As you might imagine, this is basically just
intended to be used with Better Loot.
