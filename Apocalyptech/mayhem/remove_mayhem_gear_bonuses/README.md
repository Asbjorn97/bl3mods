Remove Mayhem Gear Bonuses
==========================

Removes the bonuses applied by Mayhem parts on your gear, so they function just
like gear without the Mayhem part applied.  Gear dropped in Mayhem Mode will
technically have a Mayhem part attached to it, but the part will be
nonfunctional and should not be shown on the card.

This is mostly intended to be used along with mods which nerf the Mayhem enemy
scaling (such as my Decreased Mayhem Enemy Scaling or Mayhem Level Cheats
mods), so that mayhem gear doesn't become too OP against mostly-unaugmented
enemies.
