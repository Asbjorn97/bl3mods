Slayer Modifier Booster Change
==============================

Changes the boosters dropped by the "Slayer" mayhem modifier to be either
health regen or damage reduction buffs, instead of the default shield boosters.
This is intended to be used by roid-focused builds which intend for shields
to be down, so this modifier doesn't actively work against that character build.
