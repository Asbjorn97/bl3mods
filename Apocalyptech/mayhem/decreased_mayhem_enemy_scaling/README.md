Decreased Mayhem Enemy Scaling
==============================

Effectively just a heck of a cheat mod, this cuts back on the enemy
health/shield/armor scaling in Mahem modes by a fairly huge amount.  I actually
do like the Mayhem modifiers themselves but hate bullet-sponginess, so this
brings them down to a level I actually enjoy.

Gear with Mayhem parts attached will end up being quite OP with this mod -- I'd
recommend the use of something like my Remove Mayhem Gear Bonuses mod, to
counteract that.

This mod isn't compatible with my Mayhem Level Cheats mod, since they both
touch the same vars.
