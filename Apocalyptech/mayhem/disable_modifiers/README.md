Disable Mayhem Modifiers
========================

This is a collection of mods which individually disable a single Mayhem
Modifier each.  They can be used in conjunction with each other to ensure
that you only roll modifiers you don't mind having.

If you want to *completely* disable Mayhem Modifiers altogether, it'll
be easier to use SSpyR's [Mayhem 2 No Modifiers](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki/Mayhem%202%20No%20Modifiers)
mod, rather than all 28 of these mods.
