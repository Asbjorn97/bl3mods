Expanded Event Spawners
=======================

This is a collection of mods (one for Bloody Harvest, one for Broken Hearts,
and one for Revenge of the Cartels) which expands the areas in which their
spawn modifications take place.  For instance, Cartel members from Revenge
of the Cartels will never show up in DLC3 or DLC4, since it was released
before those.  With this mod enabled, though, cartels enemies could appear
practically anywhere.

Note that this mod, on its own, does *not* enable any of the spawns.  You'd
need to either wait for the event in question to be properly active, or use
my All Event Spawns Active mod, to turn on the global spawn changes.  This
mod just expands the range that the spawn modifications can show up in.

Note also that these still don't seem to work inside Covenant Pass and The
Droughts, so those are the main known exceptions.  This has been updated through
DLC6 (Director's Cut), though.
