Fewer Cartel Operatives
=======================

When Revenge of the Cartels is active (or its spawn modifications are active,
such as with my All Event Spawns Active mod), this mod will reduce the
frequency of coming across a Cartel operative out in the world.  I'd ended up
finding the default rate to be a little high for my liking, so this fixes it
up a bit.
