Droughts Stocked Porta-Potties
==============================

Various Porta-Potties throughout The Droughts ordinarily only provide
ammo/money and the like, without any gear attachments.  This mod fixes
them up so that they act like any other porta-potty in the game.

**Mod Compatibility Info:**

This mod is now included as part of my "Better Loot" mod, so there's
no reason to run both at the same time.  It won't hurt anything if you
do, though.
