Beef Plissken Loot Pattern Fix
==============================

Beef Plissken has a loot drop pattern which is custom-built for his in-story
death sequence, which shoots the loot up onto the platform he just jumped from.
When returning to the area later, though, you just kill Beef as usual, and that
loot pattern has a tendency to shoot the loot off the edge of the map, making
the loot unobtainable. This replaces Beef's drop pattern with the usual enemy
drop pattern.  This ends up dropping his loot on top of the masher gears when
going through the DLC6 story, but you can hop onto them without getting killed
so the loot is still retrievable during the plot mission, too.
