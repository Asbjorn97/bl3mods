###
### Beef Plissken has a loot drop pattern which is custom-built for his in-story
### death sequence, which shoots the loot up onto the platform he just jumped from.
### When returning to the area later, though, you just kill Beef as usual, and that
### loot pattern has a tendency to shoot the loot off the edge of the map, making
### the loot unobtainable. This replaces Beef's drop pattern with the usual enemy
### drop pattern.  This ends up dropping his loot on top of the masher gears when
### going through the DLC6 story, but you can hop onto them without getting killed
### so the loot is still retrievable during the plot mission, too.
