Always Visible Challenge Icons
==============================

This mod attempts to make all challenge icons (Claptrap salvages, Radios, etc)
always appear on the map, regardless of if you've been close to them.  It does
the same for Eridian Writings.  Note that you will miss dialog if you use this:
when entering a new map, only one of the available challenge intros will be
played.  Note that this currently only supports the base game, some of DLC2,
and most of DLC3.  DLC1 challenges are omitted entirely because they act
weirdly, and DLC4 challenges are omitted both because they're nearly impossible
to miss, and because my initial attempts at finding the objects failed.
Known issues:

* The third Typhon log in Meridian Outskirts won't show up until you're very
  close to it.
* The Dead Claptrap in Neon Arterial might not show up immediately,
  though it does show up before there's been too much progression
  in the level.
* A *bunch* of Legendary Hunts don't show up until you're right on
  top of them, for some reason.  Eden-6 and the second half of
  Pandora are especially finnicky about it for some reason:
  * Eden-6:
    * Floodmoor Basin
    * Anvil
    * Voracious Canopy
    * Ambermire
  * Pandora:
    * Devil's Razor
    * Splinterlands
    * Konrad's Hold
  * Nekrotafeyo:
    * The Pyre of Stars
* The Target of Opportunity in Devil's Razor
* Target of Opportunity in Cathedral of the Twin Gods
* All DLC1 challenges are omitted
* All DLC4 challenges are omitted (though you won't miss 'em anyway)
* Gaige's Gift challenges from DLC2 are omitted 'cause they act weirdly
* Some Eldritch Statue challenges from DLC2 don't seem to work.
* DLC3's "Good Prospects" are omitted since they do some weird Treasure Map
  things, and I didn't care enough to try and figure those out.
