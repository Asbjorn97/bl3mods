Thank you fellow Vault Hunter for downloading the Borderlands 3 Radiance Mod!

This is a standalone .hotfix mod intended to rework and rebalance the game. Most of the values are taken from other hotfix mods, but there are new custom values for players to have fun and enjoy the experience with. The people below helped the most with making this mod happen!

Thanks to CodyCode, SsPyR, Apocalyptech, 10 FPS, Apple1417, Grimm, and Aaron0000.

2. If you are a STREAMER, please DISABLE your Echo Cast events to avoid sharing ANY modded/event gear to viewers. 

3. If you encounter ANY bugs or scaling issues, PLEASE test extensively to ensure that when you finally do forward the report to me.
