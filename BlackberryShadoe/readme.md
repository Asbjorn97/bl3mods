Welcome to BlackberryShadoe's Hotfix Mods
=========================================

The following are my modest little contributions to the community:

## Game Overhauls

- **Shadoe's Mayhem Raid - Legacy Edition** - a complete overhaul of the Arms Race map.
  Based on bossrush, this mod replaces all enemy spawns with custom picked mini-bosses/bosses
  from base game and all DLC's, but also includes custom enemy/player health/damage scaling,
  custom loot pools, around 200 rebalanced weapons, numerous rebalanced grenades, as well
  as other gear. Enemies get tougher as the murdercain grows (yes, grows instead of shrinking)
  the phases have had increased timers, so entire map can be cleared, which takes around 90-120
  minutes and is a blast to play, especially in co-op. FULLY cross-platform compatible.
  This is currently on v1.0.1 and is released, with update v1.1.0 scheduled to be released April 2025 
- **Shadoe's Mayhem Raid** - a complete game overhaul, focusing specifically on TVHM.
  While working on an update to my original mod (what is now Legacy Edition,) I realized
  that I can make TVHM-specific changes. YAY! My biggest "issue" with BL3 (besides some scaling)
  was the fact that there is no difference between NVHM and TVHM like there was in BL2.
  I wanted some tougher enemies in TVHM. By tougher, don't just mean that they are more tanky,
  because no one likes bullet-sponges. I've introduced numerous enemy/player movement mechanics
  changes that makes everything a lot more dynamic, fluid, and engaging. It's a lot more fast paced.
  Enemies that knock you back, don't just hurt your health/shield, but actually send your character
  flying back. "Camping" is not possible, lol... There's constant engagement with more enemies
  spawning that in vanilla. ALL weapons have been rebalanced, lots of them re-worked to be
  usable and fun. A few extra weapons introduced, using various weapons in-game that are unused.
  Instead of adding new rarity, changing rarities on numerous weapons. There are way too many
  legendary weapons in the game that don't "feel" legendary. So, even after rebalancing, this is 
  now reflected in numerous weapons being green, blue, or purple tier instead. Likewise, so low-tier
  weapons have had their rarity increased, as the way they perform now warranted the change.
  ALL grenades, shields, artifacts, class mods have been rebalanced. Some character skill tree stats
  have been rebalanced specifically for this mod. Numerous QoL improvements and more...
  This version is mostly cross-platform compatible. (further explanation will be provided with mod)
  There will be a complete changelog included with release which is scheduled for April 2025

 ## Cheats

  - **Shadoe's Insane Guardian Rank and Fabricator Fix** - this is useless to those on PC as they
    can just save edit these things, but is a great utility for those that do boosting of console players.
    Can be used to instaboost a character to max level. Can be used to "instaboost" someone's
    Guardian Rank. Only about level 2200 is needed to max all % stats on left and with this mod,
    killing ONE enemy gives about 2500 levels, depending on the initial GR level of the player.
    Also includes changes to fabricator, so that eridium/cash can be dropped easily in same session
    (10 shots = 100 mil eridium/ 1 billion cash, 10 shots on altfire mode = 100 mil diamond/ALL vault card keys)
    This is currently on V1.0.0 and is released.

  ## Other

  - If and when I decide to release some of the other stuff I'm testing, I'll update this... lol

  About me:
  =========

  ##### I'm on old-head nerd that's been gaming since pong/atari/amiga/commodore64/cc3/nes... lol...
  ##### you get the picture, I've been around a little while. Passionately love video games and have
  ##### loved watching them evolve from two lines and a square moving on the screen to life-like 4k HDR,
  ##### ray-traced, gorgeous looking games with life-like physics to match it all. It's been a ride!
  ##### Have learned various programming languages, coding, and have fun with home-brew apps/games over
  ##### the years, including dabbing in modding. I am NOT the smartest person in the world and some of
  ##### all this stuff makes no sense to me, lol... Some might ask, "then how are you hotfix modding?"
  ##### Python is not a language I know how to use, so all these scripts everyone else has used to make
  ##### these mods is out of the question for me. BUT, I can see and recognize patterns, and with access
  ##### to all of the tools provided by Apoclyptech, all of the mods already here, access to the repo
  ##### with every single official gbx hotfix since game release, and the pre-serialized game files
  ##### I was able to figure out the syntax needed (although there was a lot of trial and error when
  ##### trying to implement changes that no one else has done) and start modding this game into what
  ##### I've always wanted to do with it. Having to go thru the game files manually has been extremely
  ##### tedious, but also has been a lot of fun and is how I have found numerous "new" things that
  ##### are unique changes only found in the code completely by accident. I've had a pattern of figuring
  ##### out how to change "thing B" while looking for "thing A" (although finding that too) and with every
  ##### day that I work on my mod, I'm finding even more fun stuff, some of which I'll include in a later
  ##### update to my main overhaul or as separate mods. I'm VERY active in the community in the role of
  ##### helping out console players with boosting/currency/keys/etc shenanigans and have been known to
  ##### even drop save edited modded items to those players as well. I have nearly 11k hours played on
  ##### this game since release and it's my "decompression" method after work. So, I'll stay active and
  ##### continue working on my mods, helping people out, and enjoying the game. My discord/shift: BlackBerryShadoe
