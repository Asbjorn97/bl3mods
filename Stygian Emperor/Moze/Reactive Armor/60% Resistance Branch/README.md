Moze Skill - Reactive Armor - 60% Resistance Branch
---------------------------
Created by **Stygian Emperor**

By email request from **Hyper Flares** - 
Increases the effect of the first rank of the skill by approximately 5 times in order to have 60% resistance to splash damage and 30% resistance to fire and radiation. I am not knowledgable enough to reduce the maximum number of ranks available to a skill, so ranks 2 and 3 are meant to be ignored - but I'm not going to tell anyone what to do with their cheat mods.

This is a standalone mod; only one .bl3hotfix file should be in your mod loader for Reactive Armor.

Changelog
---------
**60resist v1.0.0** (11/22/2021)**:** Initial release.

Credits
-------
- **Grimm**, for making the **Fl4k** mod from which I reverse-engineered part of this. And now special thanks for rewriting my shitty trog-code!
- **CZ47**, for making the **Amara 2.0** mod from which I reverse-engineered the rest of this, and letting me in on the games' super-secret damage resistance formula.
- **Apocalyptech**, who understands more than I could *possibly* know.
- **Hyper Flares**, who was apparently not enjoying the fact that gear Mayhem level still also increases your self-damage dealt for no good reason. Hopefully this does the trick!
