Elpis Mayaifier
=============================

Changes the post-game decal and aurora on Elpis to a more Maya-inspired one,
specifically her symbol from my BL3 rewrite (long story which I will not explain here).
Both image replacements drawn in Krita by me.

Compat
=========
Obviously not compatible with other mods that change how post-game Elpis looks.

Installation
=========
This is a pakfile mod, in order to install it
you will have to put it in your BL3 paks folder.
This mod has no hotfix component!
I recommend making a ~mods (the tilde is crucial) within said folder to keep all your pakfile mods in one place.
