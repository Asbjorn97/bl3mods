Zane Flynt's T-Boy Swag
=============================

Gives Zane's "Bane Flynt" body a pair of gnarly looking top surgery scars.
Should be compatible with any skin.
Image replacement drawn in Krita by me.

Compat
=========
Obviously not compatible with other mods that change how Bane Flynt looks; or, more precisely, the T_ZaneBandit_Body_D texture.

Dependencies
=========
Requires the Multiverse Disciples of the Vault Zane Cosmetic Pack, obviously.

Installation
=========
This is a pakfile mod, in order to install it
you will have to put it in your BL3 paks folder.
This mod has no hotfix component!
I recommend making a ~mods (the tilde is crucial) within said folder to keep all your pakfile mods in one place.
