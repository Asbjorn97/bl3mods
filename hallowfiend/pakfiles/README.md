Vaughn's Top Surgery
=============================

Slaps a pair of nice, inverted-t mastectomy scars on Vaughn's buff nerd body.
Image replacement drawn in Krita by me.

Compat
=========
Not compatible with other mods that change the T_VaughnBody_D texture.

Installation
=========
This is a pakfile mod, in order to install it
you will have to put it in your BL3 paks folder.
This mod has no hotfix component!
I recommend making a ~mods (the tilde is crucial) within said folder to keep all your pakfile mods in one place.
