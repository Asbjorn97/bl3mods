Cryo Dots
=============================

Adds cryo DoTs to the game similair to wonderlands. 
Includes my previous anima and explosive fury fixes so no need to add them seperatly. 
If you have already added said fixes I reccomend you delete them as this pack changes them further to add cryo dot synergies.
Cryo DoTs allow nimbus and elementalist to work with amaras cryo augment
Cryo dots do not work with the ele crit anoint. Cryo dots can not be procced by amaras conflux skill but can proc the skill itself


Note that there is *no* hotfix component to this mod!  No OHL or B3HM required.  The actual fix is contained in the associated pakfile.  
Get that installed along with your existing pakfiles, and you'll be good to go.
Specifically, create a directory named ~mods inside OakGame\Content\Paks in the game install, and copy the included Pakfile into there.
