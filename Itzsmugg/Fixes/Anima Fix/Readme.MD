Anima Fix
=============================

Fixes Amara's Anima skill to work with her Cold-Hearted augment.
Note that there is *no* hotfix component to this mod!  No OHL or B3HM required.  The actual fix is contained in the associated pakfile.  
Get that installed along with your existing pakfiles, and you'll be good to go.
Specifically, create a directory named ~mods inside OakGame\Content\Paks in the game install, and copy the included Pakfile into there.



Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Feb 27, 2023
 * Initial release
 
Licenses
========

The mod itself can't really be usefully licensed by a modder like myself.
The pakfile contents themselves are owned/copyrighted/whatever by Gearbox,
2K, or whoever else technically owns all that stuff.
