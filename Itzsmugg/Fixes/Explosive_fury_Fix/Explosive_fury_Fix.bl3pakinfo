### Fixes Moze's explosive fury skill so now it actually works.
### Note that there is *no* hotfix component to this mod!
### You don't actually have to import this file into either OHL or B3HM.  
### The actual fix is contained in the associated pakfile.  
### Get that installed along with your existing pakfiles, and you'll be good to go.
### Specifically, create a directory named ~mods inside OakGame\Content\Paks in the game install,
### and copy the included Pakfile into there
